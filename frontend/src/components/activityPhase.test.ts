/* The banner used to say one thing at every kind of silence.
 *
 * Reported 2026-09-13 with a screenshot: a task on webapp sat in its check
 * suite, the stream said "running the full check suite (typecheck/lint/tests)
 * — several minutes of quiet is normal here", and immediately under it the
 * yellow banner said "No activity for 3 min ... the agent is either on a long
 * model call or stuck". Both on screen at once. The suite was healthy: it
 * takes 307-311s on that project, 111 tests, and it passed.
 *
 * A check run and a review wait announce themselves and then emit nothing
 * until they finish, so the announcement is the last entry for exactly as long
 * as the phase lasts. That is the signal.
