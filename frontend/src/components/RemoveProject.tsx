/* Taking a project off the agent.
 *
 * The confirmation asks the operator to type the project's name. That is not
 * ceremony: this control sits in a list of projects, one row apart from the
 * next one, and the cost of hitting the wrong row is an archive-or-delete of
 * everything the agent learned about something that was working fine.
 *
 * The panel leads with what is NOT affected, because that is the question
 * anyone hovering over a red button in a list of their repositories is
 * actually asking. The live repo, its branches and its remote are untouched
 * unless the operator explicitly asks for them to go, which is only offered
 * when the server can show that nothing would be lost by it.
 *
 * Open/closed is the parent's state: the button that opens this sits on the
 * project row, above the panel, so the panel cannot own it. The OUTCOME goes
 * to the parent for the same reason: a removed project leaves the list, this
 * panel goes with it, and a summary rendered in here would be unmounted
 * before anybody read it.
