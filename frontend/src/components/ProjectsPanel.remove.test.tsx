/**
 * Removing a project has to be findable.
 *
 * It was reachable only by expanding a project row first, with nothing on the
 * row saying it was in there -- so the only way anyone found it was by
 * already knowing. Someone who had just added the wrong repository could see
 * it sitting in the list with no way to take it back off.
 *
 * And the second half: a repository Tektonix cloned by itself leaves a clone
 * behind that removal used to have no way to delete, so finishing the job
 * meant a shell.
