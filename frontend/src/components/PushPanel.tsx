/* Turning on notifications for THIS device.
 *
 * A push subscription belongs to a browser, not to an account: the same
 * operator legitimately has one on a phone and another on a laptop, and each
 * has to be granted separately because the permission is the OS's, not ours.
 * So everything here says "this device" and the count says how many others
 * the account has.
 *
 * The awkward cases are the whole job:
 *
 *   Permission "denied" is a dead end from JavaScript. The browser will never
 *   prompt again, and calling requestPermission() resolves "denied"
 *   immediately with no UI -- so a button that offers to try is a button that
 *   does nothing. It has to send the operator to site settings instead.
 *
 *   iOS only delivers web push to an app installed to the Home Screen, and
 *   only from iOS 16.4. In Safari's normal tab the APIs exist and subscribing
 *   appears to work, so the honest thing is to detect the tab case up front
 *   rather than let someone subscribe and wonder why nothing ever arrives.
