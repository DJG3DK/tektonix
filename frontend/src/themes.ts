/* The colour schemes, and the two functions that apply one.
 *
 * The single source of truth for WHICH schemes exist is this list plus the
 * matching [data-theme] blocks in theme.css; agent/auth.py's THEMES is the
 * server-side copy of the same set and tests/test_themes.py holds the three
 * in step. A scheme in one place and not another is the failure worth
 * preventing: the server would accept a value the stylesheet has no rule for,
 * and the operator would save a colour and watch nothing change.
 *
 * The swatches are duplicated from theme.css on purpose. A preview tile has
 * to paint a scheme it is NOT applying -- five of them side by side, each in
 * its own colours -- and CSS custom properties cannot be read out of a
 * stylesheet for a selector that is not in effect.
