"""One-time credentials are consumed once, even by concurrent requests.

Each of these was a SELECT followed by a separate UPDATE, so requests racing
on the same row all read it unused (or under its attempt limit) before any of
them wrote: one recovery code logged in twice, one reset code set two
passwords, and "five guesses at a six-digit code" was five sequential guesses
plus however many arrived at once.

Real Postgres, because a race is a property of the database, not of a fake:
AGENT_TEST_PG_DSN names a throwaway database (CI points it at the postgres:16
service), and every table is created in a scratch schema dropped afterwards.
