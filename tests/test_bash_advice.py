"""bash is for running things; reading and editing have their own tools.

Live, 2026-09-12: the test-writer subagent made 229 bash calls against ONE
edit and ONE write. It patched JavaScript with `python3 - <<'PY' ...
open(p,'w').write(s.replace(...))` and read files with `cat` and `sed -n`,
while holding `read`, `write` and `edit` the whole time.

That is a wall-clock problem, not a style one: every bash call starts a
container, and the median gap between that subagent's model calls was 11
seconds. The in-process tools cost none of it.

A note on the result, never a refusal -- writing a scratch script to RUN is a
fair use of a shell, and no pattern can tell every case apart.

# in the first half of the run to 14 in the second while bash rose from 91 to
# 132. Every compound spelling walked past the old single-file pattern, so the
# model was being told that one spelling was wrong and twelve were fine.

# The line these tests hold: reading is ALL the command does -> nudge. One
# stage that filters, searches or counts -> leave it alone, because the
# built-in glob/grep cannot see the repo (HiddenToolsMiddleware) and bash is
# then the ONLY way to search it. A nudge on a search is worse than no nudge:
# it is the false positive that teaches the model to ignore the true ones.
