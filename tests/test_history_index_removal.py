"""Removing a project has to take its searchable history with it.

The history index is a TABLE, not a store namespace, so
project_removal.namespaces() cannot reach it and the archive/purge loop that
walks that dict walks straight past it. A removed project whose rows stay
behind is not merely untidy: those rows hold the text of episodes the
pruner already deleted from the store, so they are the only remaining copy
of work that belongs to somebody who asked for it to be gone.

The same file pins the leak that was already there before any of this: the
build transcripts agent/planning_log.py writes were never in that dict
either.
