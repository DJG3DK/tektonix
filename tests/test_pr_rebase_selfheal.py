"""A pull request is rebased onto a moved base, like a merge is.

The merge path is `--ff-only`, so a base that moved stops it dead with
`diverged`, and verify_and_ship answers by rebasing the branch and reviewing
the new sha. That self-heal has existed for a while and works.

A pull request never fast-forwards. So it never hit the check, never reported
anything wrong, and pushed the branch exactly as it was cut -- opening a PR
that was already behind before anyone looked at it and, where the changes
overlapped, one that would not merge at all. Nothing self-healed it because
nothing said anything was wrong.

Found 2026-09-22 with five task branches open on one project, all cut from the
same tip, each shipping as a PR.
