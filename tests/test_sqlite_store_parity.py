"""The same behaviours, asserted against both backends -- and the places
where the two genuinely differ, asserted as differences.

A second backend is only useful if code written against one runs on the
other. The risk is not that SQLite fails loudly; it is that it succeeds
differently, and the caller that relied on the difference is somewhere else
entirely. So every test below runs twice, through the real
graph.open_store / graph.open_checkpointer, and the four known divergences
are pinned here by name rather than discovered later by a caller.

HOW THE TWO LEGS ARE OBTAINED

* SQLite: a temp file. No server, no system package, nothing to arrange --
  which is why this leg runs everywhere, including CI.
* Postgres: AGENT_TEST_PG_DSN names a database, and CI sets it to the
  postgres:16 service container in the python job. The tables are created in
  a SCRATCH SCHEMA whose name is unique to the run and dropped afterwards,
  so pointing this at a real database cannot touch its store. It is still
  not something to run against production for fun.

    AGENT_TEST_PG_DSN=postgresql://user:pw@host/db .venv/bin/pytest -q \\
        tests/test_sqlite_store_parity.py

The Postgres leg skips itself when that variable is unset, and for two years
of this file's life that was every run anywhere: the reference side of a
parity comparison had never executed, which makes "parity" a claim about one
backend. If you see those skips, the comparison did not happen -- the
SQLite assertions still stand alone, and the divergence tests still assert
the SQLite half, but nothing was compared.
