"""A snapshot of every route and the guard protecting it.

agent/server.py is 3,659 lines (2026-09-23) and holds most of the app's 98
routes in one namespace, and the intended fix is to extract it into per-domain routers (docs/todo.md). The
danger in that refactor is not that it breaks loudly -- it is that a route
quietly loses its authentication, or disappears, and the existing tests
(which mostly exercise the modules underneath rather than the HTTP surface)
stay green.

This is the safety net for that work: it pins the full inventory. Moving a
route between modules leaves this untouched; dropping one, changing its path
or method, or removing its auth dependency fails it immediately.

When a route is added or deliberately changed, update EXPECTED below in the
same commit -- the diff is then the reviewable record of what changed about
the app's surface.
