"""The scheme list exists in three places; this keeps them identical.

agent/auth.py THEMES gates what the API will store, frontend/src/themes.ts is
what the picker offers, and frontend/src/theme.css is what actually paints.
A scheme in two of the three is the failure worth preventing, and it is
silent in every direction: the server accepts a value the stylesheet has no
rule for (the operator saves a colour and nothing changes), or the picker
offers one the server rejects (Save returns 400 for a scheme that visibly
exists), or a stylesheet block nothing can ever select.

The contrast ratios are checked too, for the same reason the original palette
carried computed ratios in its comments: --text-faint spent a long time at
3.04:1 against the card surface, which is why meta text read as mush, and
nothing caught it because nobody measured.
