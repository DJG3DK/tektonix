"""GitHub's refusal to let a token write .github/workflows/, made actionable.

Live 2026-09-22: a task wrote a good `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, the review
gate passed, and the ship step reported a raw git error. Nothing in it said
the fix was one permission, which of the two token types the operator had, or
that the work was safe. These pin the answer to each of those.
