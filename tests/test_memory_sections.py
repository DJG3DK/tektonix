"""Splitting a project's memory, and choosing what of it stays resident.

The property everything else rests on is that a section is a SLICE of the
file: preamble plus every body, joined in index order, is the original, byte
for byte. If that ever stops being true, a nightly consolidation writes a
memory that loses a paragraph nobody can name, and no other test in this
suite would notice.

The rest of this file is the operator's policy (designs/ALWAYS_POLICY.md)
asserted against a memory shaped like a real one -- what gets pinned, what
gets indexed, and whether an index entry says anything a title does not.
