"""The harness: fixtures, the run loop, the budget stop and the report.

No money is spent here. The graph is a fake that returns a chosen final state,
which is enough to test everything the runner actually decides -- how it reads
an outcome, when it stops, what it scores -- without a model call. The one
thing a fake graph cannot cover is that the real graph parks on
`require_merge_review` instead of merging; that is asserted directly against
the real routing function at the bottom.
