# The Microsoft root is not in the Linux trust stores (they carry TLS roots,
# not code-signing ones), which is why a bare `osslsigncode verify` reports
# "unable to get local issuer certificate" on a correctly signed file. The
# root is fetched from Microsoft's own PKI site and pinned by fingerprint
# here, so a substituted certificate fails instead of being trusted.
