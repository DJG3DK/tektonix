/**
 * The built index.html must contain the page's real text, and no JavaScript.
 *
 * The first half is the assertion that would have caught the original
 * problem: before 2026-09-16 the built page shipped `<div id="root"></div>`
 * and nothing else, so a crawler that does not execute JavaScript saw no body
 * content at all — the only occurrences of "coding agent" anywhere were
 * inside meta tags. Google renders JS on a second, queued pass; Bing,
 * DuckDuckGo and most LLM crawlers largely do not.
 *
 * The second half is new with the split (2026-09-17): this page ships as
 * static files, so a reintroduced runtime is a regression rather than a
 * detail. scripts/render.mjs fails the build over it; this fails the tests.
 *
 * Asserts on CONTENT, not on the mechanism. If the rendering is ever replaced
 * by SSG or a different framework, these still pass; if the step is dropped
 * or silently stops emitting, they fail.
