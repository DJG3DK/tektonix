            Tektonix was created out of a need for a truly autonomous AI developer you can trust
            with your repositories. Simply provide a goal in plain English, and the agent
            independently plans the solution, writes the code, and executes your project&rsquo;s
            local test suite. To ensure absolute production safety, a secondary model reviews the
            code before it ever reaches the main branch. Tektonix runs locally on your own machine,
            giving you full control to plug in any model via OpenRouter.

                Same app, same setup. The first time you run it, it installs itself into your app
                menu. If Docker isn&rsquo;t there it installs it (on Arch-based distros like CachyOS
                too), asking for your password once, and then just carries on: no logging out. Your
                projects stay owned by you, not root. It updates itself from then on.

                This is how I run it. The installer takes a fresh clone to a running agent:
                prerequisites, secrets, database, sandbox image and dashboard. It asks three
                questions and figures out the rest. <code>--dry-run</code> shows everything it
                would do without doing it.

                Agent, database, router and the review gate as one stack, if you&rsquo;d rather
                only install Docker. Put your OpenRouter key and projects folder in <code>.env</code>,
                start it, and open <code>localhost:8100</code>. The one thing it can&rsquo;t do is
                restart your own app after a merge; that needs the host install.
