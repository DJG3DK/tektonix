"""The newsletter signup behind tektonix.io.

Deliberately not part of the agent. It belongs to the landing page -- the same
reasoning that moved the page out of the product: a self-hosted Tektonix has
no business shipping an endpoint that writes to tektonix.io's mailing list.
`site/` is excluded from the release tarball, and this goes with it.

It does one thing: take a name and an address from the form on the landing
page and write them down. Nothing sends yet, on purpose.

No JavaScript at the other end
------------------------------
The landing page ships zero JavaScript, so this is a plain HTML form POST.
That shapes the whole interface:

  * form-encoded input, not JSON;
  * the answer is a 303 to a real page, because a status code with a JSON body
    is not something a browser would show anyone;
  * every outcome has a page, including failure, since there is no script to
    render an inline error.

A duplicate signup is a SUCCESS. The person's intent was "put me on the list",
they are on the list, and an error would send them away thinking it had not
worked. It is also a no-op: the row keeps its name, and an address that
unsubscribed stays unsubscribed. There is no double opt-in, so a signup is
not proof it came from the address's owner, and letting it re-subscribe or
rename somebody who left would let anyone do that to anyone (2026-09-29
audit, S1).

On storing addresses
--------------------
Name, address, when, and a token for the unsubscribe link the first issue will
need. Addresses are never written to the log -- a log line is the easiest way
for a mailing list to leak, and this one would leak into a file that gets
tailed over someone's shoulder.
