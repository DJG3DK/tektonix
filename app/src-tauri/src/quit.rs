//! has chosen it, shut Tektonix down: the stack's containers stop, and so
//! does Docker Desktop when this app is what started it. Until 2026-10-03
//! Quit left the stack running ("the stack keeps running"), and the
//! containers went on holding gigabytes of memory with no window left to
//! say so. An update's restart is not a quit and leaves the stack alone.

//! The decisions are here as plain functions so each is a table test; the
