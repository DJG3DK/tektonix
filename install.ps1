.SYNOPSIS
    Tektonix installer for Windows and macOS: the Docker bundle, set up for you.

.DESCRIPTION
    install.sh is the HOST install -- nginx, certbot, pm2, a package manager --
    and none of that exists on Windows. The bundle is the path that already
    runs anywhere Docker does, and the agent's own bind-mount translation was
    written for Windows drive letters on purpose (agent/tools/sandbox.py,
    host_path). What was missing was never the runtime. It was this: the four
    steps between a fresh copy of the source and a running console, one of
    which is `cp`, which is not a command Windows has.

    So this does what docker/README.md tells a person to do by hand. It checks
    Docker is actually usable, writes the .env, asks for the two values that
    have no sensible default, and brings the stack up.

    Nothing here is Windows-only -- it runs under PowerShell 7 on macOS and
    Linux too -- but Windows is the reason it exists.

.PARAMETER ProjectsDir
    Where your repositories live on this machine. Everything under it appears
    to the agent as /projects/<name>.

.PARAMETER OpenRouterKey
    Your OpenRouter API key. Read from the OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment
    variable when not passed.

.PARAMETER DryRun
    Print every action without performing any of it. Same idea as
    `./install.sh --dry-run`.

.PARAMETER Yes
    Never prompt. Every value must already be present, in the environment or
    as a parameter, or the run fails saying which one is missing.

.EXAMPLE
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
    Asks for what it needs and starts the stack.

    The -ExecutionPolicy is not optional advice. Windows client editions
    default to Restricted, so `.\install.ps1` on a machine nobody has changed
    fails with "running scripts is disabled on this system". Passing it on the
    command line applies to that one process and leaves the machine's own
    setting alone -- which is the right trade for a script somebody just
    downloaded.

.EXAMPLE
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1 -DryRun
    Shows what it would do, touching nothing.

<#
Set one KEY=value in a .env file's text, returning the new text.

Rewrites the key in place when it is already there, so re-running never leaves
two assignments of the same name -- the later one silently wins in some
parsers and the earlier one in others, and the operator sees their value
apparently ignored. A commented-out line is left alone and the real assignment
added, because a comment is documentation, not configuration.

separator: compose joins onto this value, and "C:\code\" would produce
"C:\code\\name".

<#
Whether a value is usable as PROJECTS_DIR, and why not when it is not.

Relative paths are rejected rather than resolved: the value is handed to the
Docker daemon, which resolves bind mounts against its own notion of the
filesystem and not against the directory this script happened to run in.

Run a native command, returning its combined output and exit code.

This exists because of one PowerShell rule that bites hard here: with
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop', ANY line a native program writes to stderr
becomes a terminating error. Docker writes its ordinary progress there --
"Image postgres:16-alpine Pulling" is stderr -- so a normal, healthy build
killed this script before it could look at the exit code, and the person saw
a PowerShell stack trace instead of the explanation below it.

Exit code is the only thing that says whether a native command failed. This
turns stderr back into text and reads that code.
