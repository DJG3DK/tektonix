# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues **privately**, not in a public issue.

Use GitHub's private reporting: **Security → Report a vulnerability** on
[github.com/DJG3DK/tektonix](https://github.com/DJG3DK/tektonix/security/advisories/new).
That opens a channel only the maintainer can see.

Include what you'd want to receive: what you did, what happened, what you
expected, and the smallest reproduction you have. If it involves the agent
executing something it shouldn't, the exact prompt or task text matters —
that *is* the payload.

This is a single-maintainer project, so expect a first response in days, not
hours. You'll get an acknowledgement, a fix or an explanation of why it isn't
one, and credit in the release notes unless you'd rather not be named.

## What this project is, threat-model-wise

Tektonix runs an LLM that writes and executes code against your repositories.
That is the product, not a bug — so it's worth being precise about which
capabilities are intended and which would be real vulnerabilities.

**Working as designed** (please don't report these as vulnerabilities):

- The agent runs arbitrary shell commands. It does so inside a Docker
  container with only that project's worktree mounted, `--cap-drop ALL` and
  `--security-opt no-new-privileges` — but it is genuinely running model-chosen
  commands, on purpose.
- The agent can modify any file in a project you onboarded. That's the job.
- An admin can point onboarding at any directory inside `AGENT_PROJECT_ROOTS`.
  Narrowing that root is the operator's control.
- An admin can create a directory under `AGENT_PROJECT_ROOTS` from the
  dashboard, and a private GitHub repository with it, using a token the
  same admin stored. The name is validated as a single directory name, a
  path that already exists or resolves outside the roots is refused, and
  the request is audited.
- An admin can remove a project from the dashboard. That deletes the agent's
  workspace, its deploy key and — if they choose delete rather than archive —
  everything the agent learned about it. It does **not** touch the live
  repository, and that boundary is what `tests/test_project_removal.py`
  exists to hold. The action is audited and refused while work is in flight.
- Web push sends alert text through a push service run by Google, Mozilla or
  Apple. The payload is end-to-end encrypted to the browser's own key, so the
  service cannot read it, but it does learn that a message was sent, when, and
  roughly how big — so push bodies carry the same short summaries the Telegram
  alerts do and never a diff. The signing key (`keys/vapid.json`) never leaves
  the box; only its public half goes to the browser.
- Model output is not trusted-but-verified so much as *gated*: an independent
  review service and (optionally) a human approve every merge.

**Genuine vulnerabilities** — please do report:

- Escaping the sandbox container, or reaching host paths outside the mounted
  worktree from an agent tool call.
- Reading or exfiltrating a secret the agent shouldn't see: `.env` contents,
  another project's credentials, a deploy key, `AUTH_SECRET_KEY`, session
  tokens.
- Authentication or authorization bypass: acting as another user, reaching an
  admin endpoint without an admin session, accessing a repo outside your
  `allowed_repos`, defeating TOTP.
- Onboarding a path outside `AGENT_PROJECT_ROOTS`, or getting a command into
  a project's check/build config that the server didn't itself propose.
- Prompt injection that escalates *privilege* — content in a repo, a web page
  or a task description that causes the agent to take an action the operator's
  settings should have prevented (bypassing the approval gate, pushing without
  review, disabling a control).

  `tests/test_prompt_injection.py` is the fixture for this claim: a repo file
  that tells the agent, in as many words, to disable merge review, read the
  deploy key and force-push. It pins the containments that make the text
  inert — the tool surface has nothing that reaches a control, the endpoints
  refuse an unauthenticated call, the container mounts only the workspace and
  carries no credential, and the approval gate is decided from the account's
  own setting before any file is read. It is a regression test, not a proof:
  injection is contained here by what the text cannot reach, never by the
  model declining to follow it.
- Anything that lets an unauthenticated request reach a code-execution path.

## Where agent-authored code runs

The agent's shell is sandboxed. Its `write`/`edit` tools are not — they put
files directly in the project's worktree, which is the job. That means a file
the agent wrote is code, and the question that matters is *where* anything
runs it.

**The reviewer runs it.** `commit-reviewer` executes each project's configured
checks — `npm test`, a lint, a build — against that worktree. On a host
install this service runs as root, so until 2026-09-21 a test file the agent
wrote was arbitrary code executing as root outside any container: a complete
path from "model in a container" to "root on the machine". `sealedEnv()`
already stopped secrets reaching those commands; it did nothing about what
they could do once running.

**What it does now**, decided per deployment because the right answer differs:

| where | what runs checks | why |
|---|---|---|
| host install | the sandbox container | the reviewer is root on the real machine |
| compose bundle | the reviewer process | it is already in a container, and `docker-compose.yml` deliberately gives the socket to `agent` alone |
| neither available | **nothing — the review refuses** | see below |

Handing the bundle's reviewer the Docker socket so it could start a sandbox
would give that container host-root equivalent, which is worse than the
containment it already has. That is why the bundle is not "not done yet".

**It fails closed.** If Docker or the sandbox image is missing on a host
install, the check does not run on the host instead — it returns a refusal
saying so. "Fall back when the sandbox is unavailable" is the path an attacker
would engineer, and it is also the change someone makes later to stop a red
build. This costs nothing in practice: the agent's own shell already requires
Docker, so a box without it is not producing work to review.

**Containment mirrors the agent's own**, deliberately, rather than being a
second policy: same image, `--cap-drop ALL`, `--security-opt
no-new-privileges`, memory/CPU/pid limits, `--network none`, argv rather than
a shell. Two hardening policies drift, and the weaker one is the one that
decides.

### The network opt-in, and what you are agreeing to

Checks run with no network, because dependencies are installed by the time
they run. One real check needs egress anyway — `pnpm audit` queries an
advisory database — so a check may set `network: "bridge"` in `projects.json`.

That file lives outside the worktree, so **the agent cannot grant its own code
network access**. What an operator is agreeing to, per check, is that this one
command runs agent-authored code *with* egress. Grant it to a package
manager's own audit path; think harder before granting it to a test suite.

The dependency installs (`composer install --no-scripts --no-plugins`, `mix
deps.get`) run with network for the same reason — fetching is the point. They
were previously argued safe as "the non-executing kind", which does less work
than it looks: `mix deps.get` evaluates `mix.exs`, and `mix.exs` is Elixir the
agent could have written. They are contained now too.

### A project that is not Node or Python

The agent's sandbox image carries Node and Python. `agent/provisioning.py`
detects and configures checks for Go, Rust, Ruby, Elixir, Java, PHP and .NET
as well, so containing checks in that one image would have turned every
review red for anyone whose project is not JavaScript.

So the image is chosen per CHECK, from `docker/stack-images.json` -- the same
list `scripts/verify_stack_checks.py` already proves in CI. Per check rather
than per project, because a Go backend with a React frontend is an ordinary
repository and its two sets of checks belong in two different images.
Detection stamps the stack when a project is onboarded, which is the only
moment it is known: by the time `projects.json` is written, `go vet` is just
a command.

A stack with no entry falls back to the default image rather than failing --
the map can gain entries after a config was written, and refusing a check
because its label is new is worse than running it where it probably works.

`node scripts/check_sandbox_tools.js` probes every configured check's command
against its own image and says which are missing, which images are not pulled
yet, and who needs them. It runs inside `scripts/doctor.py`, so an existing
install finds out before its next review rather than during it. A missing
toolchain is reported as a **setup** error naming the tool, never as a failing
check -- an environment error read as a code failure gets handed back to the
agent, which then tries to debug an environment it cannot see, and a correct
commit is rejected round after round.

### The database checks, which stay on the host

Three commands still run outside the sandbox on a host install: a project's
`db:drift`, `db:seed` and `test:e2e`. They are agent-authored code, and they
are the exception to everything above.

They talk to Postgres and Redis on this machine's loopback. Inside a
container `localhost` is the container, so containing them means one of two
things: `--network host`, which is not containment; or rewriting each
project's DSN to the bridge gateway and exposing those services to it. Both
trade a working review for a boundary weaker than the one they would buy.

What bounds them instead is real but partial. The commands come from
`projects.json`, which lives outside the worktree and the agent cannot write.
The database is a throwaway, created before and dropped after. The
environment is constructed for the run rather than inherited: `PATH`, `HOME`,
`LANG`, `CI` and `DEBIAN_FRONTEND`, plus the throwaway `DATABASE_URL`, a
`REDIS_URL` on a scratch database, and freshly generated JWT and encryption
secrets — nothing of the reviewer's own, so its router key and control secret
are not in it. (Until 2026-09-23 this sentence was true of the checks and
false of these three commands, which inherited the reviewer's full
environment; `tests/test_db_check_env.py` now pins it.) What is **not** bounded is the code
those commands execute — that is the repository under review, and it runs as
root on the host.

Everything else that was in this position has moved: the checks, the build,
the package-manager installs, schema generation, and the build assertions all
go through the sandbox now. This is the residue, and it is written down
rather than left to be discovered.

Closing it properly means the reviewer's database dependencies moving into
the compose stack, where a container can reach them by service name. That is
the fix, and it is not built.

### What this does not fix

- **The Docker socket in the bundle.** `agent` is given
  `/var/run/docker.sock` so it can start sibling sandboxes. Anything that can
  reach that socket can ask for a privileged container, so this is host-root
  equivalent for that container. `sandbox.py`'s mount allow-list is a guard in
  the *client*; a socket proxy enforcing it server-side is the fix, and is not
  built.
- **Egress from the sandbox itself.** The agent's own shell runs on the
  default bridge. SSRF is guarded host-side (`agent/tools/url_guard.py`), not
  at the network layer.
- **A project with no checks** is reviewed without running anything, so none
  of this applies to it.

## The review services

The review dashboard (`:4100`) and the commit reviewer's control port
(`:4101`) hold the only write path into a live repository, and publish no
port. On a host install they bind loopback; in the container bundle they bind
the compose network, because the agent is a different container. That network
also reaches the agent's sandboxes, which have ordinary network access — so
binding is not the boundary there. The shared secret is: every route on both
services except `/health` requires `X-Review-Secret`, reads included (until
2026-09-23 the dashboard's reads — every project's diff among them — were
open). `/health` stays unauthenticated for monitoring and names nothing: the
reviewer reports how many projects are under review, and names them only to a
caller holding the secret. `tests/test_review_services_gated.py` starts both
and asks from outside.

## Sessions, links and second factors

### Approve links

A GitHub inbox alert on Telegram or email carries a link that can start a task
with nobody signed in — the person is on a phone with no session. The token in
it is the credential: HMAC-signed, bound to one inbox item, valid for 48 hours,
and single-use. Opening it (`GET`) only shows what would happen and a button;
messengers fetch links for previews, so a `GET` never acts. The button posts
the token in the form body, and that `POST` is refused cross-site (the same
`Sec-Fetch-Site` rule as the review dashboard) and rate-limited per address.
Both pages are `no-store`, and every response is `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`.

What stays is that the token is in the link's URL, because a link is what an
alert can carry. Anywhere the URL is recorded before it is used — a proxy log,
a chat backup, a screenshot — someone holding it can start that one task. The
task still goes through the review gate and, with final merge review on, stops
for a person before anything merges; the budget is the project's inbox budget.
Treat an alert link like the alert: it is for the person it was sent to.

## Deploying this safely

- **Never expose the dashboard directly to the internet.** It is an operator
  console. Put it behind a VPN, an SSH tunnel, or a reverse proxy with its own
  authentication — [INSTALL.md §3a](INSTALL.md#3a-reaching-it-from-another-machine)
  covers all three. The app has its own login and TOTP, but it was designed to
  sit behind something, not to be the perimeter.
- **Keep `AGENT_PROJECT_ROOTS` narrow.** Onboarding grants an agent write
  access to whatever it points at.
- **Treat the review gate as load-bearing.** `Final merge review` and the
  independent reviewer exist because a model can be confidently wrong; turning
  both off means unattended merges to your live repos.
- **Deploy keys, not account keys.** Each project gets an SSH key scoped to one
  repository (Settings → Projects → Push access) rather than a credential that
  can reach everything you own. A repository created from the dashboard is
  handled the same way: the GitHub token is used for two API calls — create
  the private repository, register the project's freshly minted deploy key on
  it — and the first push of `main` goes over that key from the API process
  on the host, on an admin's request. No agent ever holds the token or the
  key, and `git push` stays on the agent's blocked-command list.
- **Budget ceilings are a safety control too.** `DEFAULT_BUDGET_USD` bounds a
  runaway loop's cost.
