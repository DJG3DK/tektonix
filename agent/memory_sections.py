"""Splitting a project's AGENTS.md into sections, and deciding which of them
stay in the prompt.

Project memory is loaded whole into every seat's system prompt, on every
model call, of every task. That was right while it was small. Measured on
2026-09-21 the largest project's memory was 41,699 chars (~10,424 tokens)
across 14 `##` sections, a median 108 model calls per task, and one of those
sections -- relevant to perhaps one task in ten -- was 55% of the file. The
file also only ever grows: the nightly consolidator is asked for everything
still true, plus what is new.

So memory becomes what skills already are here: a small always-resident part
plus an index of what can be fetched. The operator's rule for which is which
(designs/ALWAYS_POLICY.md) is implemented in `stays_always` below, and the
reasoning for it is worth keeping next to the code, because it is not the
obvious rule.

Everything here is text in, text out -- no store, no backend, no IO. The
reader (agent/deep_agent.py) and the migration that writes the section files
both drive these functions. That is what makes the one property this whole
subsystem rests on -- the preamble plus every section body, joined in index
order, IS the original file, byte for byte -- something a unit test can
assert instead of something a live database has to be trusted for.
