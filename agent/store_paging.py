"""Reading a whole store namespace, and reading the newest N of one.

There were four copies of this loop in the tree and each one had picked a
different subset of the hazards. This is the copy from agent/audit.py, which
had all of them, lifted so there is one.

The hazards, because they are not obvious from the call:

* `asearch(ns, limit=N)` is not "the whole namespace" unless N happens to be
  larger than the namespace. It is a page.
* A short page does not mean the last page. A store may cap a page below
  whatever was asked for, and treating a short page as the end made a log
  that had hundreds of rows read as two rows long.
* A store need not support `offset` at all, and one that accepts it is not
  obliged to honour it. Paging with offset against a store that ignores it
  returns page one forever.

And the one that arrives with a second backend: SQLite's `updated_at` has
one-second resolution where Postgres has microseconds. A burst of writes
therefore shares a timestamp, and `ORDER BY updated_at DESC` falls back to
insertion order within the tie -- oldest first, the exact reverse of what
Postgres returns. Anything that took a bare `limit=N` as "the newest N" was
silently correct only on Postgres. `recent_items` is that call, written so
it is correct on both.
