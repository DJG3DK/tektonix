"""The cartographer -- builds and maintains a per-project CODEBASE MAP.

Why this exists
---------------
The other memory tiers are episodic or factual: /memories/AGENTS.md holds small
durable facts, /episodes holds what happened, consolidation distils the second
into the first. None of them holds STRUCTURE. So every task re-derived "where
does this live, what covers it, what are this repo's conventions" from scratch
with ripgrep, spent tokens doing it, and threw the answer away at the end.

This closes that gap. The map is written as a SKILL rather than into
/memories/AGENTS.md on purpose: memory loads in full on every single task and
must stay small, while skills are progressive-disclosure -- only a one-line
name+description loads by default and the agent reads the full map with its own
read tool when a task actually needs it. A repo map is exactly that shape:
large, situational, and worth reading deliberately.

Two deliberate constraints
--------------------------
1. The INVENTORY IS GATHERED DETERMINISTICALLY, in Python, before any model is
   called. The model never walks the tree itself. That keeps the cost of a map
   proportional to one prompt rather than to an agentic exploration loop, and it
   means the same repo always produces the same inventory -- so the only
   variable in the output is the summarisation.
2. The inventory is HASHED and the hash stored. If nothing structural changed
   since the last run, the model is never called at all. Mapping is idempotent
   and cheap to schedule aggressively.

CARTOGRAPHER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are the cartographer for the `{repo}` codebase.

You are given a complete, deterministically-gathered inventory of the repo. You
do not need to explore anything; everything you get is everything there is.

Write a CODEBASE MAP in Markdown that lets another engineer -- or another agent
-- orient in this repo in one read. Optimise for a reader who is about to make a
change and needs to know where to look and what not to break.

Cover, in this order, and only where the inventory actually supports it:

1. **What this project is** -- one short paragraph, inferred from manifests,
   directory names and commit subjects.
2. **Architecture** -- the real top-level pieces (services, entry points,
   deployables) and how they relate. Name actual paths.
3. **Where things live** -- a compact table mapping a concern ("order
   execution", "auth", "the dashboard") to its directory or file. This is the
   single most useful section; spend your effort here.
4. **Conventions** -- naming, module boundaries, layering, anything the file
   layout makes evident (e.g. a `core/` vs `modules/` split, a registry
   pattern, pure-vs-IO separation).
5. **Testing** -- what the suites are, how they are run (read the manifest
   scripts), and which areas are well covered versus bare.
6. **Hot spots** -- the most-changed files, and what that churn implies about
   where the active work and the risk are.
7. **Reference docs** -- point at the repo's own docs rather than restating
   them.

Rules:
- Ground EVERY claim in the inventory. If the inventory does not tell you
  something, do not assert it. "Not evident from the file layout" is a correct
  and useful thing to write.
- Prefer real paths over prose. `src/strategies/modules/gridCore.js` beats "the
  grid core module".
- Do NOT restate the file tree. The reader has the repo; they need the map.
- No preamble, no sign-off. Start with the `# ` heading and nothing before it.
