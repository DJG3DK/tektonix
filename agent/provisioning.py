"""Project onboarding: inspect a directory, propose a configuration, and
provision it as a project this agent can work in.

Why detection PROPOSES rather than decides
------------------------------------------
Everything in a project's config falls into one of three buckets:

1. Derivable with certainty (is it a git repo, which package manager,
   which npm scripts exist). Detected and applied.
2. Derivable as a candidate (which gitignored files look like secrets the
   test suite needs, which pm2 apps serve this path). Detected, PROPOSED,
   and shown to the operator to accept or reject.
3. Not derivable at all. The canonical example lives in this deployment:
   one project's `test:auth` and `test:routes` make real HTTP calls to
   a live service -- a live service of the operator's -- and `test:routes` exercises
   POST /trade/open. Running them unattended would place real orders for
   zero review signal. No static analysis reliably distinguishes "hits a
   test server" from "hits your production system", so this module FLAGS
   the suspicion and refuses to silently enable such a script.

So the wizard is deliberately detect -> confirm -> provision, never a
one-click guess. A wrong guess here doesn't produce a bad config; it
produces an unattended agent running destructive commands against
production.
