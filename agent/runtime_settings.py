"""Operator-tunable runtime limits, stored rather than baked into the image.

These were module constants and env vars, which meant every adjustment was a
file edit plus a restart -- and a restart is exactly what you cannot do while
the thing you want to retune is running. They now live in the same Postgres
store as skills and memory, so they survive restarts, ride along in the
backup, and take effect on the NEXT turn or task without one.

That last property is not incidental. Every value here is read at the point of
use -- inside build_planning_agent, build_deep_agent, or the verify_and_ship
node -- so a change lands on the next unit of work and never mutates something
already in flight. A task that started under a $2 ceiling finishes under it.

Deliberately NOT here: anything that changes what the system is allowed to do.
Auto-approve and merge review are per-user safety switches with their own
endpoints and their own reasoning. These are dials on how hard it tries before
giving up, which is a different kind of decision and a safe one to expose.
