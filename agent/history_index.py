"""A keyword index over what past tasks ran into.

Every terminal task writes an episode: the goal, how it ended, what it cost
and -- when it went wrong -- the reason. There are ~458,000 tokens of them
and nothing can query a single one. The consolidation agent distils the
recurring patterns into memory, which is the right thing to do with a
pattern and the wrong thing to do with a one-off: a single three-month-old
escalation that says exactly why this merge cannot fast-forward is not a
pattern, so it never reaches memory, and it is unreachable from anywhere
else.

Worse than unreachable. agent/consolidation.py's _prune_consolidated_episodes
DELETEs episodes past the retention window, so that history is not merely
unqueryable, it is on a path to being destroyed. This table is therefore
also the archive: a row demoted to source_live = FALSE still carries the
text after the store row is gone.

Why a table of our own
----------------------
langgraph's `store` table is not ours to index, for three reasons and only
the first is about ownership:

* Pruning. An index keyed to store rows loses exactly the old one-off this
  exists to find, at exactly the moment it is deleted.
* Write amplification. A GIN expression index on `store` is maintained on
  EVERY store write, and agent/planning_log.py's Recorder.flush rewrites a
  jsonb document of up to 2000 entries every 20 seconds during a live turn.
  That is a cost on the hot path of the thing that must not slow down.
* The text we want to search is not the text the row stores. An episode is
  a FileData document whose `content` is a JSON string; a task log is
  {"entries": [...]}. Each needs its own extraction and its own field
  weighting, and an expression index over `value` can do neither.

So: a sibling table in the same database, migrated the way langgraph
migrates its own -- a version counter and a list of statements applied by
index, every one of them idempotent, safe to run on every startup.

Weighting is the whole design
-----------------------------
`err` (an episode's escalation_reason, a task log's error lines) is weight
A, the one-line label is B, everything else is D. Measured on the real 146
episodes: a weighted ts_rank_cd for "fast-forward merge failed" returned the
four merge failures, with the two carrying the error in escalation_reason
above the two that only mention merging in prose. Unweighted, that query is
a grep.

Reading it back
---------------
search() ranks, fetch() opens one record whole, and neither is reached by an
agent directly. Both go through agent/episode_recall.py: this module
registers itself there as a retrieval LEG when an index is installed, and
the tools in agent/tools/history_tools.py ask the registry rather than this
table. That indirection is the only thing that lets a second way of looking
things up -- an embedding, later -- arrive without touching a tool, a seat
or a prompt.

    that the day an embedding leg lands, nothing about the tool, the seats
    or the prompts changes -- the fusion just has two rankings to combine
    instead of one.

    `store` is ignored here and taken anyway: it is part of the leg
    contract, because a leg that reads the store is the normal case and
    this one happening not to is an implementation detail of this one leg.

    `**kwargs` is not laziness either. Legs are called with one set of
    arguments by one caller, and a leg that raised TypeError on an argument
    meant for a different leg would take the whole search down with it --
    recall_episodes drops a leg that raises.
