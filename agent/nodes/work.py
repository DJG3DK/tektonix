"""work_node -- manually drives a deepagents-built agent (see agent/deep_agent.py)
for one outer-graph pass. Not native LangGraph subgraph nesting: the outer
AgentState and the deep agent's own state share no keys, so
`builder.add_node("work", deep_agent_graph)` would produce a schema-merge
mess for zero benefit. This is a plain node function that invokes the deep
agent's own `.astream()` against a derived, distinct thread_id
(f"{task_id}:work") on the same Postgres checkpointer/store instances the
outer graph uses -- one pool, two thread namespaces that never collide.

Four cases for what to send the deep agent this pass, decided from outer
state alone (no inspection of the inner thread's own state needed):
  0. Resuming after a human-in-the-loop approval decision (approval_decision
     set -- see deep_agent.py's INTERRUPT_ON): takes priority over every
     other case. Sends `Command(resume={"decisions": [...]})`, not a
     HumanMessage -- LangGraph's native interrupt-resume protocol, which
     resumes the same inner thread exactly where interrupt() paused it, with
     the model seeing whatever ToolMessage the decision produces (approve:
     the tool actually runs; reject: a synthetic rejection message).
  1. First-ever invocation for this task (iteration_count == 0, no pending
     feedback): send the goal as the initial HumanMessage.
  2. Looping back after verify_and_ship rejected the prior attempt
     (pending_feedback set): inject that as a new HumanMessage into the same
     inner thread -- the deep agent keeps its own todo-list/message
     continuity rather than starting over.
  3. Resuming after an orphaned restart (iteration_count > 0, no pending
     feedback -- verify_and_ship never got to inject anything because the
     process died mid-"work"): send no new input at all, just continue the
     existing inner thread from its own checkpoint.

Streaming: uses `agent.astream_events(..., version="v3")`, not plain
`.astream(stream_mode="updates")` -- subagent-delegated work (e.g. an
investigator or test-writer subagent) is invisible to `stream_mode="updates"`
on the coordinator's own thread, since deepagents runs subagents via a
`task()` tool call whose internal steps never surface as top-level graph
updates. `run.values` (a full state snapshot per superstep, not a delta)
drives the root coordinator's own progress -- new messages are detected by
tracking how many messages have been seen so far, since `values` reports the
whole accumulated list every time. `run.subagents` yields a typed handle the
moment each subagent starts, exposing its own `.values` the same way the root
run does, so subagent progress is consumed by the identical `_consume`
helper, just tagged with the subagent's name instead of "work". All consumers
run concurrently via asyncio.gather -- required because subagent handles can
arrive (and need consuming) while the root run is still mid-stream.

Every consumer shares ONE already-seen set, and that is load-bearing. Each
projection reports its whole accumulated message list on every superstep, so
a consumer that starts with an empty set republishes the entire history it can
see. A per-consumer set therefore replays everything each time a handle
arrives: measured on task 279c29fd (2026-09-12), 1328 of 1864 logged tool
results were replays, the same burst reappearing verbatim up to three times
(`{bash: 74, write: 3, write_todos: 2}` at 17:59, 18:38 and 18:46). That is
what "the same commands are being spammed" in the live view was -- a harness
artefact, not a model loop -- and it inflated every count on the Analytics
tool panel with it. Message ids are unique, so one shared set is both
sufficient and necessary.

Human-in-the-loop: after the values/subagents consumption above completes
(which happens naturally when the graph pauses at an interrupt() -- no
exception, the stream just ends there), `run.interrupted()`/`run.
interrupts()` are checked to distinguish "the agent actually finished this
turn" from "a tool call matched deep_agent.py's INTERRUPT_ON policy and the
graph is paused waiting for operator approval". A real
`langgraph.types.Interrupt` object's `.value` is exactly the HITLRequest
dict HumanInTheLoopMiddleware built -- stored as-is in `pending_approval` for
the dashboard to render and an operator to act on.
