"""Three shapes of a wrong fix the ship gate can see in the diff itself.

Two 50-task SWE-bench samples (2026-09-25) lost the same tasks the same way
while the coder's prompt said, in words, not to: an invented error message
where the tests assert the existing template; a grammar rewritten so that it
accepts what it used to reject, with tests for the parsing side only; a fix
applied to one of two functions of the same name, the sibling untouched.
A rule in a long system prompt lost to the decision in front of the model
every time. These fire at the decision point instead -- once each, as a
loop-back with the specific thing to change -- and only on a benchmark
project for now, where the hidden tests are what they are calibrated on.
