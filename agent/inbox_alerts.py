"""Is the Dependabot alert a task was created for still open?

A task from the GitHub inbox names its alerts in its goal ("Fix Dependabot
security alerts #6, #8 and #9 ...") and links the repository's alert page.
When another change closes those alerts first -- on 2026-09-29 one bump
closed eleven, and ten tasks then rebased, re-reviewed and merged a
lockfile change that fixed nothing -- the task has nothing left to ship
and says so instead of taking the project's merge slot. Never raises: a
question GitHub cannot answer is "unknown", and unknown ships as before.
