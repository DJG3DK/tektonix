"""Reads and edits this agent's own model pins in model-router/config.yaml --
strictly scoped to the agent-* entries (see MANAGED_ROLES). Other entries
in that file are not this agent's to set and are never read or written
here. The unnamed fallback targets (deepseek-v4-pro, claude-haiku-4.5,
gpt-4o-mini) exist as router_settings.fallbacks destinations.

(The SIMPLE/MEDIUM/COMPLEX/REASONING tier system that used to live there was
removed on 2026-09-13 along with smart-router and reasoning-tier -- built for
OpenHands, which was archived three weeks earlier, and called once in the
router ledger's entire history.)

config.yaml is shared, heavily-commented living documentation for another
service, not something safe to round-trip through a generic YAML dump --
writing a pin change does a surgical text replace of just that one role's
`model:`/cost lines, leaving every comment and every other entry in the
file byte-for-byte untouched.

# What each role actually asks a model to DO — and what has been VERIFIED,
# rather than what a catalog claims.
#
# Three capability axes, because they fail independently:
#   tools       - the role hands the model callable tools
#   structured  - the role constrains the output shape
#   strict      - the model is FORCED into a particular response shape. Two
#                 variants exist here and both break the same models:
#                   * tools + structured output in one request  (Consolidator)
#                   * tool_choice pinned to a specific function (Reviewer)
#
# `strict` is the one that breaks models. Only the Consolidator needs it, and it
# is where every non-Gemini candidate tested has failed:
#
#   Consolidator shape (ProviderStrategy + tools, tool must actually be called),
#   probed 2026-08-25 through this router:
#     google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview  PASS
#     qwen/qwen3.8-max               FAIL  — 200 OK, silently skipped the tool,
#                                            invented an answer, claimed it used
#                                            the tool. The dangerous failure.
#     z-ai/glm-5.3                   FAIL  — 404, no endpoint takes the params
#     z-ai/glm-5.2                   FAIL  — native structured output returned

# shape, tool actually invoked: all seven tool-using roles PASSED on their
