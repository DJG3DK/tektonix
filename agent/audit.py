"""Who changed what, kept where it survives a restart.

This system was built for one operator, and for one operator the answer to
"who approved that?" is always the same person. The moment a second account
exists, it stops being: an admin flips another user's auto-approve, someone
sets a GitHub source to Auto, someone generates a deploy key, and a week
later the only record is a Telegram message in a chat that may have been
cleared -- if notifications were even switched on.

Telegram is not an audit log. It is a notification channel: best-effort,
unordered, per-recipient, and deleted at the whim of whoever owns the chat.
This is the log: append-only in the same Postgres store that holds tasks and
memory, so it rides along in the backup and outlives every restart.

What goes in here is deliberately narrow. Not "everything that happened" --
every task and every model call is already recorded elsewhere -- but the
decisions that *move a control*: who was granted access to skip a gate, who
onboarded a project, who approved a specific gated command, who let an inbox
source create tasks on its own, who minted a key that can push.

Writing a record never blocks the thing being recorded. An approval that
fails because the log write failed would make the log a new way to break the
system; instead a failure is logged at ERROR and the action proceeds. The
trade is deliberate and worth knowing about when reading this page as
evidence: it is a very good record of what happened, not a court exhibit.
