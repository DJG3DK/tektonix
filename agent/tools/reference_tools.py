"""Reading another project, from inside a build task.

A build task is scoped to one repository, and that scoping is a security
boundary rather than a convenience: the sandbox bind-mount allow-list
(agent/tools/sandbox.py) exists precisely so a symlink or a rewritten .git
pointer cannot turn into `-v /home:/home:ro` and hand the task every other
project's .env, this agent's secrets and ~/.ssh.

But "use the checkout flow from the other project as a template" is an
ordinary thing to ask for, and until now the only way it reached a build task
was as prose in the plan -- the planner could read both projects, the builder
could read neither but its own. Typed straight into the task composer, it
could not be done at all.

These four tools are the narrow version of that. They are host-side and
read-only: no mount, no write path, no bash, nothing that changes the size or
shape of what the sandbox exposes. What they add is the ability to READ a
named project the task's creator was already allowed to read.

Three things keep that narrow:

  * The list of readable projects is resolved when the task is CREATED, from
    its creator's own access, and carried on the task. A task runs under the
    access its creator had at the time -- the same rule auto_approve_commands
    and require_merge_review already follow.
  * The task's OWN repo is refused here and pointed back at the normal tools.
    Two ways to read the same file with different path semantics is how a
    model ends up editing through the wrong one.
  * Reads come from each project's worktree, which is the agent's own copy,
    not the operator's live checkout.
