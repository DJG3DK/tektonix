"""Noticing when a shell command was really a file edit or a file read.

Observed live on 2026-09-12, task 01e640ef: the test-writer subagent made 229
bash calls against ONE edit and ONE write. It was patching JavaScript by
piping Python heredocs -- `python3 - <<'PY' ... s = open(p).read();
open(p,'w').write(s.replace(...))` -- and reading files with `cat` and
`sed -n`, when it had `read`, `write` and `edit` tools the whole time.

That is not a stylistic preference. Every bash call spawns a fresh container:
the median gap between that subagent's model calls was 11 seconds, nearly all
of it container startup and teardown. `read`/`write`/`edit` run in-process and
cost none of it. The same work through the right tools is roughly an order of
magnitude faster in wall-clock, and it is also safer -- `edit` is path-guarded
to the repo root and its repeat-guard catches a model retrying an edit that
already failed, neither of which a shell heredoc gets.

Observed again on 2026-09-12, task 279c29fd, at the other boundary: the coder
reached for `/memories/AGENTS.md` through bash twice -- `grep -n "..."
/memories/AGENTS.md | head` -- while writing its memory at the end of a task.
That path does not exist inside the container at all. It is the agent's own
store-backed filesystem, reachable only through the built-in read_file /
write_file / edit_file tools, so the command can do nothing but cost a
container and return "No such file or directory".

The write case is worse than a wasted container, and it is why this check runs
BEFORE the write patterns below. `cat >> /memories/AGENTS.md` goes three ways
wrong at once: the bytes land in a container that is thrown away, the shell
reports exit 0 so the model believes it succeeded, and the generic write note
would send it to `edit` -- which is path-guarded to the repo root and rejects
/memories outright. One wrong tool pointing at another.

So: a note on the result, never a refusal. Blocking would be wrong -- writing
a scratch script to RUN is a legitimate use of a shell, and the harness cannot
reliably tell the difference in every case. A short line pointing at the
cheaper tool costs one line of context and stops being emitted the moment the
model takes the hint.

# Reading files through the shell.
#
# The first version of this matched only a command that did NOTHING but read
# ONE file. Measured on task 3ee0d030 (2026-09-14): an investigator made 219
# bash calls and 17 of them were flagged -- 8%. Every compound spelling walked
# straight past: `cat a b c`, `sed -n '1,80p' a && sed -n '1,80p' b`,
# `cat x | head -60`, `awk 'NR>=40 && NR<=90' x`. Its `read` use fell from 46
# calls in the first half of the run to 14 in the second while bash rose from
# 91 to 132, and the honest reading is not defiance: a harness that objects to
# one spelling and says nothing about twelve others is telling the model that
# the twelve are fine.
#
# So a command counts as a read when EVERY stage of it is a read. The stages
# below are the ones that only move bytes out of a file; anything that filters,
# searches, counts or transforms (grep, rg, sort, wc, jq, an awk PATTERN rather
# than a line range) makes the command a search, and a search is what bash is
# genuinely for -- the built-in glob/grep tools are hidden because they cannot
# see the repo at all (deep_agent.py's HiddenToolsMiddleware), so bash is the
# ONLY way to search it. Flagging that would be wrong, and would teach the
# model to ignore this the way the narrow version did.
