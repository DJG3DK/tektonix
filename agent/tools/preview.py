"""Looking at the app it just changed.

A frontend task used to be done blind: edit the CSS, run the tests, and
neither the agent nor the reviewer ever saw the page. `preview_app` closes
that -- it starts the project the way the project starts, waits for it to
serve, and renders it in a real browser so the agent can see what it did.

Two things it is careful about.

The container is torn down in a finally, always. A dev server left running on
a published port outlives the task that started it, and the next one gets a
port conflict from a process nobody remembers.

And the browser's SSRF guard stays on. The model chooses the command and the
path; this module chooses the host and the port. So "preview my app" cannot
become a way to fetch 127.0.0.1:4101 or a cloud metadata endpoint -- exactly
one loopback origin is allowed, the one this process just allocated.
