"""The headless browser's only way out: a local proxy that connects to the
address it checked.

url_guard's route handler resolves a request's host and checks every
address, then hands the request back to Chromium -- which resolves the host
again, itself, to connect. A name that answers with a public address to the
first lookup and 127.0.0.1 to the second (DNS rebinding, a TTL of zero) passes
the check and reaches loopback anyway. Nothing inside the route handler can
close that: it never owns the connection.

So Chromium is launched behind this proxy, with loopback forced through it
too (Chromium bypasses a proxy for loopback by default). Every request, plain
HTTP or a CONNECT tunnel, arrives here with a hostname; this resolves it ONCE,
applies url_guard's rule to every address, and opens the socket to the
address it just checked. There is no second lookup to rebind.

One exception, the same as url_guard's: the single loopback origin a preview
was started on, matched as host and port.
