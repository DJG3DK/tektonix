"""Runs the repo's own real typecheck/lint/test npm scripts -- never a
hand-reconstructed check list, since a mismatch between what's actually
configured and what a check runner assumes is exactly the kind of gap that
can let a real regression through undetected. Shared by the agent-facing
`run_checks` tool (lets the deep agent self-verify cheaply, during its own
work) and the outer `verify_and_ship` gate (the actual hard, code-enforced
gate that never trusts the agent's own self-report), so both call the exact
same logic. Only the outer gate's result has any authority over shipping;
the tool exists purely so the agent gets faster feedback than waiting for
that gate.

NOTE FROM THE CHECK RUNNER: this output contains a network/DNS error.

The check suite runs in a container with NO NETWORK (`--network none`),
deliberately -- it executes agent-authored test code, so it gets no
egress. Dependencies are already installed in the workspace, so checks
that only compile and run local code are unaffected.

So a failure like `getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN <host>` is almost certainly
the sandbox, not the change under review. Confirm by checking whether
the same test fails on an unmodified checkout.

If a test genuinely needs the network, it does not belong in the review
suite: mock at the layer that performs the request. A common miss is
mocking `global.fetch` when the code calls a wrapper that resolves DNS
first (an SSRF guard, for instance) -- the lookup throws before fetch
is ever reached.
