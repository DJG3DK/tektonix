"""Tools for the planning chat agent (agent/planning_chat.py) -- a
research/consulting role, not a code-editing one. No write/edit/bash here
deliberately: the planning chat never mutates the target repo itself, it
only reads it for context and drafts a plan document that later gets handed
to a real build task (which has its own full write/edit/bash toolset). That
also means there's no INTERRUPT_ON-style approval gate needed here, unlike
investigator/test-writer -- nothing in this tool list can touch the
filesystem destructively. create_project is no exception: the tool itself
mutates nothing, it records a proposal in plan_ref; the project is created
only after an admin confirms it from the dashboard, through the same server
path as POST /api/projects/create.

Playwright (not a plain httpx GET) is the actual point of `browse_page`: a
raw HTTP fetch can't render JS-heavy pages or take a real screenshot, and
"how does this page actually look" (colors, layout, spacing) is exactly what
a design/UX planning conversation needs that a text-only fetch can't give.
Confirmed working headless on this VPS (chromium already cached under
~/.cache/ms-playwright from another project's Playwright install) with the
same --no-sandbox launch args that project already uses in production.

web_search scrapes Bing's HTML results, not an API -- there's no search API
key configured anywhere in this deployment (see .env), and DuckDuckGo's own
HTML/lite endpoints return a hard 403 from this VPS's IP (confirmed, not a
scraping bug on this end -- likely datacenter-IP blocking on DDG's side).
Bing has no such block and returns real, parseable results. This is a
scraping dependency, not a stable API contract -- if Bing changes its markup
this will need updating. Swapping in a paid search API (Tavily/Brave/Bing
API) later is a drop-in replacement for just this one function.

    """Returns ([web_search, browse_page, preview_app, list_project_dir,
    read_project_file, search_project, find_files, save_brief, save_plan,
    create_project], plan_ref).

    `is_admin`/`actor` are the caller's role and email, threaded in
    explicitly the way `allowed_repos` is (agent/routers/planning.py
    send_planning_message -> server.py build_planning_agent -> here). They cannot be derived from
    `allowed_repos`: it is None for admins AND for legacy unscoped accounts,
    so only an explicit flag can gate create_project the way the endpoint it
    feeds (POST /api/projects/create) is gated. Both default off, so a caller
    that builds the tools without a user gets a planner that can propose
    nothing.

    plan_ref also carries "brief": the dict save_brief last wrote (seeded from
    `existing_brief`), which BriefFirstMiddleware/PinnedBriefMiddleware read
    (agent/middleware/pinned_brief.py). `skills_manifest` ({name: description})
    is what save_brief matches the request against to tell the model which
    architecture skills to read before it opens a repo file.

    Unlike agent_tools.py's read/list tools (closure-bound to one repo_root
    at construction time, matching a build task's single-repo scope),
    list_project_dir/read_project_file take `repo` as an explicit argument --
    planning is deliberately cross-project: comparing how two of this
    operator's projects each solve something, or pulling a pattern from one
    into a plan for another, is real, common planning-conversation value that
    a single-repo-scoped tool can't provide at all.

    `plan_ref` is a mutable dict (`{"markdown": str | None}`) the caller
    reads back after each turn -- same pattern as agent_tools.py's
    last_failed_edit_ref: the tool's closure is the only thing that can see
    the model's save_plan call as it happens, so the result has to come back
    through a shared mutable reference, not a return value (tools return
    strings to the model, not structured data to the caller).
