"""SSRF guard for any URL an LLM gets to choose.

`browse_page` drives a real headless browser on the host, with host network
access, on a URL the model supplies. Before this existed there was no check
at all, and both of these worked (verified live 2026-08-24):

    file:///etc/hostname     -> returned the host's hostname
    http://127.0.0.1:4101/   -> reached the review service's control port

That control port is unauthenticated precisely because "localhost only" was
treated as the boundary, and `file://` reads anything the process can read --
including this agent's own .env. Even driven only by the operator, a page the
agent browses can carry an injected "now fetch file:///..." instruction and
the contents land in the transcript (and from there in traces). For the
public demo bot, where the prompt comes from the internet, it is the whole
ballgame.

Three checks, because any one alone is bypassable:

 1. Scheme allow-list. `file:`, `data:`, `gopher:`, `view-source:` and
    friends have no business here; only http/https.
 2. Resolve-then-validate. Checking the hostname string is useless --
    `evil.example` can simply have an A record of 127.0.0.1. Every address
    the name resolves to must be publicly routable.
 3. Re-validate on redirect. A public URL that 302s to 169.254.169.254
    defeats an entry-only check, so the caller re-runs this per hop (see
    guarded_route_handler, which Playwright invokes for every request the
    page makes, redirects and subresources included).
