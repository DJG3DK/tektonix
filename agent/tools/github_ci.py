"""The base branch moves only on a green GitHub Actions run.

After the review service passes a commit and the operator approves it, a
project that ships by pushing does not fast-forward its base branch straight
away. The task branch goes to GitHub with a pull request against the base,
which is what starts a repository's `on: pull_request` workflows, and this
waits for every workflow run on that exact commit. All green: the caller
fast-forwards the base and pushes it, and GitHub closes the pull request as
merged, because its head is now on the base. Any red: the failing jobs go back
to the agent as feedback, and nothing lands.

Skipped, never failed, where there is nothing to wait for: no workflow files in
the commit, an origin that is not GitHub, no GitHub token for the project,
`"ci_gate": false` on the project in projects.json, or a benchmark project. A repository with workflows that start
no run for this commit (path filters, a trigger on other branches) is let
through after a grace period, and the log says so.
