"""Designing a logo, and turning it into a brand kit.

LogoLoom (mcpware/logoloom, MIT) does the parts a language model is bad at:
converting `<text>` to outlined `<path>` so a logo renders without the font
installed, optimising the SVG, tracing a raster image, and exporting a full
kit of PNGs, favicons, social images and a BRAND.md. It does NOT design
anything -- the model writes the SVG. That is worth being plain about,
because the pitch reads as though the tool produces concepts and it does not:
what it produces is everything that happens after a concept exists.

It ships as an MCP server. Tektonix has no MCP client, and the server's four
tools are thin wrappers over four local Node modules, so this calls the
modules through services/logoloom/bridge.mjs rather than adding a protocol to
reach functions already on disk. Three of the four are used as they are; the
tracer is re-implemented there, because upstream's shells out with the
caller's path in the command string and passes flag names the current vtracer
no longer has. See that file's header.

`logo_render` is not upstream's. A model writing SVG is working blind in
exactly the way a model editing CSS was before preview_app: the tests cannot
tell it whether the mark looks like anything, and neither can the reviewer.
sharp is already here to rasterise, so the render goes to the vision model
and comes back as a description. Design without it is guessing.
