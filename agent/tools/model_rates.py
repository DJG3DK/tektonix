"""Per-model $/token rate table, loaded once: OpenRouter's live pricing for
every model the LLM router's own config.yaml pins, with the config's own
model_info rates as the fallback.

Only used as a fallback for BudgetGuardMiddleware's cost read. The router's own
computed response_metadata["token_usage"]["cost"] is preferred when present
(it's the proxy's own exact billed cost), but that field is absent entirely
on every call that goes through agent.astream_events(..., version="v3") --
OpenAI-compatible streaming responses carry standard token counts
(usage_metadata) but not the router's extra cost annotation, regardless of
stream_usage/stream_options. This computes cost from
usage_metadata.input_tokens/output_tokens against this table instead.

Cache-aware: many OpenRouter-routed models bill a cached-prompt-token read
at a steep discount off the base input rate (confirmed against OpenRouter's
own public pricing: one pinned model's cache-read rate is roughly 1/5th its
base input rate). A long tool-calling conversation resends nearly the same
prefix on every turn, so the overwhelming majority of a later call's "input
tokens" are cache reads, not fresh ones -- treating all of them as full-price
input (as a naive per-token calculation does) can overestimate real cost by
several times on exactly the kind of long, looping conversation this exists
to catch. All three rates are taken from OpenRouter's own public,
unauthenticated pricing endpoint, once per process lifetime, because that is
what the router is actually billed; config.yaml's two base rates are the
fallback when OpenRouter is unreachable. An undated pin the catalog does not
list by name (`qwen/qwen3.8-max` vs the catalog's `qwen3.8-max-0902`) is
resolved through the per-model endpoints resource -- the miss used to fall
back to full input price on cache reads and overstated one turn 4.7x.

Even so, this is the fallback: the budget is enforced against the router's
own billed cost wherever it can be had (see router_ledger.py).
