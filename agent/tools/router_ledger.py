"""The router's own per-call bill, read back into the budget.

BudgetGuardMiddleware has to price every model call itself, because the router's
exact cost annotation does not survive OpenAI-compatible streaming (see
budget_guard.py). An estimate computed from token counts and a rate table is
only as good as the table: on 2026-09-08 a planning turn was ended at
"$8.09 spent" when OpenRouter had billed $1.72 -- the pinned model id was
missing from OpenRouter's catalog, so its cache-read discount fell back to
the full input rate and 4.9M mostly-cached prompt tokens were charged 8x.

The router knows the true figure the moment each call completes: it
asks OpenRouter for `usage.cost` on every request and hands it to
the router's own ledger writer, which appends one line per call to
logs/routing.jsonl, keyed by the same `x-router-call-id` the proxy returned
in the response headers. This module reads that record back. The tracker
carries each call at its estimate until the router's line lands, then swaps
in the billed cost -- so the running total the ceiling is enforced against
is the router's own number for every call but the one that just finished.

Best-effort by design: the file lives beside the router, so an agent talking
to a router on another host (MODEL_ROUTER_LEDGER unset and no local file)
simply never resolves anything and the estimate stands, exactly as before.
