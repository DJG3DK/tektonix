"""Asking what past tasks ran into, from inside a task.

Every terminal task leaves an episode -- the goal, how it ended, and when it
went wrong, the actual text of the failure. Nothing could read one. The
consolidation agent turns recurring patterns into memory, which is right for
a pattern and useless for a one-off: the single escalation from three months
ago that says exactly why this merge cannot fast-forward is not a pattern, so
it never reaches memory, and until now it was reachable from nowhere.

Two tools, deliberately, and not three. `search_history` returns a DIGEST --
a line of metadata and a highlighted fragment per hit, enough to decide which
record is worth opening -- and `read_history` opens one. The split is the
whole economy of the thing: an episode runs to thousands of tokens, so eight
of them returned whole would be ~25,000 tokens spent before the model has
decided any of them is relevant, while eight digest entries are under a
thousand.

There is no second search tool either, and there will not be one when an
embedding index arrives. Two tools answering "have we hit this before" over
one corpus is a routing decision a model gets wrong half the time, and each
description is prompt tokens in every seat that carries it. A new way of
looking things up registers as a LEG in agent/episode_recall.py, which is
what these tools ask -- never the index directly.

Cross-project reach goes through agent/tools/reference_tools.py's own gate,
imported rather than re-derived: a task may search the history of exactly
the projects its creator could read. The one difference is inverted on
purpose -- the reference tools REFUSE your own project (two path semantics
for one file is how a model edits the wrong copy) and these DEFAULT to it,
because there is no file to confuse and the question almost always means
"here".
