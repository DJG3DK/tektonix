"""Pulling a section of project memory that the prompt only advertised.

The index in the system prompt is a promise: these sections exist, here is
what is in each one, fetch the one you need. This is the other half of it.

It is a named tool rather than the built-in read_file for one reason -- a
model reads what its prompt tells it to read, and "call read_memory_section
with the slug" is an instruction the index can state in the same line as the
slug, while "read /memories/sections/<slug>.md with read_file" asks it to
know which of the two filesystems in this system that path lives on (see
_FILESYSTEM_GUIDANCE in agent/deep_agent.py -- getting that wrong is an
established failure here, not a theoretical one). It also gives the read a
place to be counted, which is how anyone finds out whether the index works.

The escape hatch is deliberate. "all" returns the whole file, because when a
model is unsure, one expensive call that definitely contains the answer beats
three cheap ones that might not -- and it puts a floor under how badly a bad
index entry can fail.
