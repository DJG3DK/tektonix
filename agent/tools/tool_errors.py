"""Turn an unexpected tool exception into a tool RESULT the model can read.

Why this exists at all: langgraph's ToolNode default error handler
(_default_handle_tool_errors, langgraph/prebuilt/tool_node.py) returns a
message ONLY for ToolInvocationError -- the "you called this tool with the
wrong arguments" case -- and RE-RAISES everything else. So an exception
escaping a tool body doesn't fail that one tool call, it tears down the whole
graph run: astream_events stops mid-turn, run_planning_turn's caller gets a
traceback, and there is nothing left alive for the model to retry with. A
recoverable mistake the model would have shrugged off in one turn kills the
entire session instead.

That is exactly how a planning session died on read_project_file(repo=...,
path=".git/HEAD"): every project sandbox is a git WORKTREE, and a worktree's
`.git` is a one-line pointer FILE, not a directory (agent/tools/sandbox.py's
mount code documents the same fact from the other side) -- so opening
`.git/HEAD` raises NotADirectoryError [Errno 20]. read_project_file caught
only FileNotFoundError, so it escaped and took the turn down with it.

This is the net UNDER each tool's own error handling, not a replacement for
it: a message from here is generic by definition, and a model recovers far
faster from "that path runs through a file" than from "OSError". Keep
catching what you can describe well; this catches what you didn't predict.

GraphBubbleUp is re-raised deliberately: GraphInterrupt (deep_agent.py's
INTERRUPT_ON approval gate) and ParentCommand are control flow, not
failures -- swallowing one would turn an approval prompt into a silent
"ERROR" string and wedge the gate forever. asyncio.CancelledError needs no
special case: it derives from BaseException, not Exception.
