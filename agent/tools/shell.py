"""Shell execution — deliberately non-interactive by construction.

A bash tool that runs commands against a real pty can hang forever waiting
on an unanswered interactive prompt (e.g. a package manager's
unapproved-build-scripts confirmation) -- a real outage risk for anything
running unattended. asyncio.subprocess with PIPE (no pty) and CI=true means
any tool that checks for an interactive terminal or the CI env var takes its
non-interactive path instead of prompting, and a hard timeout means even a
tool that ignores both fails loudly instead of hanging silently.
