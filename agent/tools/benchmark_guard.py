"""On a benchmark project, the agent does not go looking for the answer.

2026-09-24, SWE-bench sample: tasks spent most of their budget searching for
the published fix -- git's object store, `git log --all`, `pip download` of
the fixed release, `find`/`grep` across the whole filesystem, even a search
for the grader. Nothing was there to find (no later commits, no network, no
grading tests); one task spent 41 turns on it and made no edit, and such a
trajectory disqualifies a leaderboard submission. The task statement says so
(agent/evals/swebench.py); this refuses the searches themselves, with the
same explanation, for benchmark projects only. Reading the repository, a
file's own history and installed dependencies stays allowed.

`screen()` judges a command segment by segment. 2026-09-25, 50 tasks: most
of the 62 refusals were compounds like `grep -rn x django/ ; find / -name
json.py`, and the lost `grep` would have found the regression the task then
failed on. Only the hunting segments are dropped; the rest runs, with a note
on the front of its result naming what was refused and why. A pipeline is
one segment, and a command the splitter cannot see through (a heredoc, a
loop, a subshell) is judged whole. The same run added the hunts the first
patterns missed: stale `__pycache__` bytecode (listing the hidden tests'
names), `git branch -a`, `git tag`, `git for-each-ref`, `gh api`,
`~/.cache/pip`.
