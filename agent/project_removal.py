"""Taking a project back off the agent, and putting it back later.

The rule this module is built around, and the reason it is not just three
lines of rmtree: **the live repository is never touched.** Removing a project
from Tektonix means the agent forgets it -- the worktree it built in, the
deploy key it minted, the memory it accumulated -- and means nothing at all
about the operator's own checkout, their branches, their remote, or their
code. A "remove" that deleted someone's repository because they wanted the
agent to stop watching it would be unrecoverable and entirely our fault.

The one exception is deliberate and is the opposite of destructive:
`core.sshCommand` is unset on the live repo, because the agent set it when it
minted the deploy key. Leaving it would point their git at a key file that no
longer exists and break every push they make by hand.

Archive or delete
-----------------
The agent's knowledge of a project is spread over six store namespaces: its
memory, its episodes, the skills it generated, its planning sessions, their
transcripts, and its task history. `archive` serialises all of it to one JSON
file and then removes the rows; `delete` removes them without the file.

The archive exists so that re-adding the same project later is a continuation
rather than a fresh start -- the codebase map, what the agent learned about
the project's conventions, and the history of what it already tried. It is a
plain file so an operator can see it, copy it, and delete it; the onboarding
wizard offers to restore it when a project of the same name is added again.
