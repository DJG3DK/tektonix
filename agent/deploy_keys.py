"""Per-project SSH deploy keys, so a merged change can reach the git remote.

Where the push actually happens
-------------------------------
The agent never pushes -- `git push` is in its blocked-command list. After a
merge is approved, the REVIEW SERVICE pushes from the project's LIVE checkout
(services/agent-review/server.js). That push uses whatever credentials that
checkout has, and it is deliberately best-effort: no `origin`, or a rejected
push, is reported but never rolls back an already-completed merge.

The consequence for a fresh install: the merge succeeds, the deploy succeeds,
and the remote silently stays behind. This module exists to make that
configurable up front rather than discovered later.

How a key is applied
--------------------
Not by rewriting ~/.ssh/config, and not by a global key -- both would leak one
project's credentials into another's git operations. Instead the private key is
written to a 0600 file and the LIVE repo is told to use it for its own
transport only:

    git -C <live> config core.sshCommand "ssh -i <key> -o IdentitiesOnly=yes"

Per-repo config, so each project pushes as itself, and nothing outside that
repo's git commands can reach the key.

Handling of the secret
----------------------
The private key is write-only from the API's point of view: it can be
installed and replaced, and its fingerprint and status can be read, but there
is no endpoint that returns it. Same contract as the credentials panel.
