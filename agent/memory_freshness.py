"""Memory freshness: which remembered facts cite a file that changed since
the fact was recorded.

/memories/AGENTS.md is loaded in full on every planning turn and every build
task and treated as established fact. It has no timestamps, and consolidation
rewrites the whole file nightly, so nothing in the file itself says how old a
line is. The operator opened the 2026-09-08 trendSignal planning session
with "a lot of changes have happened to this repo, so your memory is stale" --
and the planner's answer was to re-read the repo for twenty minutes.

This module makes staleness announce itself instead:

- `find_path_mentions` pulls every repo path a memory line cites (exact path
  or a basename unique in the tree).
- The cartographer keeps a LEDGER per project (/.memory-freshness.json in the
  project namespace): line-hash -> first date the cartographer saw that line
  cite that path. That date is the best available proxy for when the fact was
  recorded, and it is exact from the day this ships.
- `stale_flags` asks git for each cited file's last commit date; a fact whose
  file changed AFTER the fact was first seen is flagged.
- The flags are rendered once, stored beside the ledger (/.memory-stale.md),
  and appended to the memory block of both agents' prompts by
  `memory_with_freshness` -- no git call on the prompt hot path.

A flag is a hint, not a verdict: the file changed, so the fact deserves a
glance before it is trusted. Nothing is deleted from memory automatically.
