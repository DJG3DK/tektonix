"""Who is speaking, in the agent's own conversation.

Everything Tektonix itself says to the model or refuses it -- a guard's
refusal, a checkpoint, the ship gate's feedback, a handover to another seat,
the framing of a benchmark task -- is marked as the harness, and what the
operator wrote is marked as the operator. A trajectory is read by the
operator, by leaderboard reviewers, and by the model itself; none of them
should have to guess which words were the system's (operator's rule,
