"""The dashboard's metrics, computed from this deployment's own records.

Until now three Analytics panels -- per-role model usage, tool reliability and
trace health -- were read back out of LangSmith. That made an optional,
third-party, off-box service load-bearing for the question "what is this agent
doing", and it cost more than it looked: profiled on 2026-09-12, the redacting
tracer that has to run for those traces to be safe was burning ~100% of a core
and doing it on the event loop.

Everything those panels need, this box already writes down:

* `services/model-router/logs/routing.jsonl` -- one line per model call, with
  the alias asked for, the model that served it, prompt and completion tokens,
  the router's BILLED cost, the duration, and (since 2026-09-12) the cached
  prompt tokens and the task the call belonged to. This is strictly better
  data than the traces were: LangSmith never knew what OpenRouter charged.
* `logs/tool_events.jsonl` -- one line per tool result, written by the work
  node as it streams (see agent/tool_events.py).
* the Store -- tasks and their outcomes.

Retention is the honest limitation. Both logs are trimmed by size, so these
numbers cover the recent past rather than all time; the window each panel
actually had is reported alongside it rather than implied.
