"""The consolidation agent -- the documented deepagents pattern for
background memory maintenance: "a deep agent that reads recent conversation
history, extracts key facts, and merges them into the memory store... on a
cron schedule" (LangChain's own recommendation, not something invented for
this system). Runs separately from any task's own coordinator agent, on a
schedule (see scripts/run_consolidation.py), not during task work itself --
keeping the per-task hot path small is the entire point.

Reads this project's episodic records (agent/nodes/verify_and_ship.py writes
one per task at every terminal outcome) since the last consolidation run,
plus the CURRENT semantic memory (/memories/AGENTS.md), and produces an
UPDATED semantic memory -- distilling durable, non-obvious patterns across
multiple task outcomes rather than relying solely on the coordinator's own
ad-hoc mid-task edits (which still happen too; this is a second, more
deliberate mechanism layered on top, not a replacement).

Deliberately NOT a full agentic tool-loop: this is a bounded read-then-write
task with a small, fixed amount of input (recent episodes + current memory),
so a single structured completion is more reliable than an open-ended
tool-calling loop for it. Still built via create_deep_agent (not a bare LLM
call) per the docs' own "a deep agent" framing, and so it has real file
tools available if it ever needs to verify a claimed convention against the
actual repo rather than trusting an episode's summary blindly.

file that captures durable, genuinely useful patterns without becoming a noisy log of every task ever \

Good candidates to add: a recurring failure mode across multiple episodes (worth a standing warning), \
a convention that got violated and caused an escalation (worth stating explicitly so it doesn't \
happen again), a gotcha that cost real iterations/budget to discover.

Bad candidates to add: one-off task-specific details that won't matter again, anything already \
captured in the current memory, vague restatements that don't add real information.

If the episodes don't suggest anything worth adding, return the current memory UNCHANGED -- do not \
pad it with filler to seem useful. You may use your read/investigate tools against the real repo to \
verify a claimed convention is still accurate before committing it to memory, if that seems warranted."""
