"""How long this project's check suite actually takes.

The dashboard's idle banner needs to tell "quiet because a test suite is
grinding" apart from "quiet because something is wedged", and the honest
answer is per project: webapp's curated review suite is 111 tests and runs
307-311s, while a small repo's is twenty seconds. A fixed threshold is wrong
for one of them whichever number is picked.

So the gate measures its own runs and remembers the recent ones, and the
announcement it streams carries the estimate. A median, not a mean: one
pathological run (a cold dependency install, a machine under load) should not
move the number that decides whether a normal run looks broken.

Telemetry, so every failure here is swallowed -- a task must never fail
because we could not write down how long something took.
