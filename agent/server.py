# Static frontend, mounted last so it never shadows an /api/* route above.
# A single-page app with one real route today, but the catch-all fallback
# means adding client-side routes later won't need a matching nginx change.
#
# Cache headers are the whole reason this isn't just a bare StaticFiles
# mount. Nothing here sent any Cache-Control at all, which does NOT mean
# "don't cache" -- with only a Last-Modified to go on, browsers fall back to
# heuristic caching and are free to reuse index.html for a while. index.html
# is the file that names the content-hashed bundle, so a stale copy of it
# pins the browser to the PREVIOUS deploy's JS/CSS: new code ships, the
# server serves it correctly, and the operator still sees the old UI until
# they happen to hard-reload. Confirmed live 2026-08-23 (this exact bug: a
# rebuilt chat composer was being served and simply never appeared).
#
# The fix is the standard split for hashed-asset SPAs:
#   * index.html      -> no-store. Never reused; every load re-reads which
#                        bundle is current. It's ~400 bytes, so revalidating
#                        it on each load costs nothing.
#   * /assets/*       -> immutable, one year. Safe precisely BECAUSE the
#                        filename contains a content hash -- different
#                        content is always a different URL, so a cached copy
#                        can never be stale. This is what keeps the split
#                        cheap: the tiny file is always fetched, the 690KB
#                        one is cached hard.
