"""Web push: the same alerts Telegram already carries, delivered to a phone.

Why this exists alongside agent/notify.py rather than inside it: Telegram is a
third party the operator has to set up an account and a bot for, and it does
not exist on a locked phone as "the Tektonix app said something". Web push
does -- an installed PWA (see frontend/public/sw.js) gets a system
notification with the app's own icon, on Android and on iOS 16.4+.

The fan-out itself is NOT duplicated. notify.notify_operators sends to both
transports from one place, filtered by one copy of `_may_hear_about`, because
two fan-outs are two chances for the scoping rule to drift and start telling a
single-repo user about every project.

VAPID
-----
Push services (FCM, Mozilla, Apple) will not accept an unsigned push. VAPID is
an EC P-256 keypair the server holds: the public half goes to the browser as
`applicationServerKey` at subscribe time, and every send is signed with the
private half. The pair must be STABLE -- regenerating it silently invalidates
every existing subscription, and the symptom is "notifications just stopped"
with no error anywhere -- so it is written once to a file beside the deploy
keys (never into the repo) and read back thereafter.

What is deliberately not here
-----------------------------
No payload beyond a title, a body, a URL and a tag. The subscription endpoint
belongs to a push service run by Google, Mozilla or Apple, and the payload is
end-to-end encrypted to the browser's key -- but the SERVICE still learns
timing and size, so alert bodies stay as short as the Telegram ones and carry
no diff content.
