"""A plan whose counter cannot go backwards.

`write_todos` REPLACES the whole list -- that is the tool's contract -- and a
model asked to update its plan often complies by writing what is LEFT. Seen
live on 2026-09-12, task 01e640ef: twelve items with six completed became a
fresh six-item list with nothing completed, because the model wrote only the
remaining work. Nothing was lost and nothing had regressed; 23 files were
already changed and 967 lines deleted.

What the operator saw was the step strip falling from 6/12 to 0/6, twice, and
concluded the task was looping. That is the expensive part: a counter that
resets is indistinguishable from lost work, and the honest state of the run
was the opposite.

There is a second, worse consequence. `latest_todos` is not decoration -- the
commit gate reads it to decide whether the plan is finished, and
`incomplete_plan_streak` escalates a task whose plan never completes. A list
that keeps coming back all-pending can hold a finished task open.

So progress is merged rather than replaced: an item that was ever completed
stays completed, and one that disappears from a later list is kept (completed)
instead of vanishing. The model stays free to re-plan -- new items arrive,
reworded items arrive, the order is the model's -- but the record of what it
finished is the system's, not a thing each rewrite can erase.
