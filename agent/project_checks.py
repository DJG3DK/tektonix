"""Checks for a project that shipped without any.

A brand-new project (the dashboard's "New project" flow, or an operator who
skipped the wizard's check step) has nothing for the reviewer to run. Its
first merge is therefore a review in name only -- and the moment that merge
lands is the first time the repository has real code to inspect, so it is
also the first moment detection can propose anything. This module runs that
detection once, right after a merge, for exactly the projects the REVIEWER
says have no checks, and writes the recommended set into projects.json.

Two things deliberately shape the code here:

* "Has checks" is the reviewer's answer, never projects.json's. The
  reviewer's built-in config (services/commit-reviewer/builtin-projects.local.js)
  wins key-by-key over projects.json, so a project can have checks the
  agent's config file cannot see. Asking projects.json would write a second,
  competing set over a hand-tuned one.
* Nothing in here may raise. The post-ship hook runs inside
  verify_and_ship's outer try/except, which turns ANY exception into an
  escalation of a task that has already shipped -- the same discipline
  tests/test_post_ship_cartographer.py pins for _refresh_codebase_map.
