"""Finding the episode that already answers this.

"Have we hit this before?" is one question, so it gets one answer, however
many ways there turn out to be of looking it up. A full-text index over the
episode text is one way. An embedding of the same text is another, and it
finds the case full text cannot: a months-old episode about a different part
of the tree that shares no words with today's task but describes the same
shape of problem.

Those are LEGS, not features. Each one registers here, each one returns its
own ranking, and the rankings are fused. Two retrieval tools over one corpus
would be a routing decision a model gets wrong half the time, and would cost
its description in prompt tokens in every seat that has it.

Fusion is reciprocal rank -- position, never score. A cosine distance and a
text rank are not on the same scale and nothing sensible calibrates them
against each other; their ORDERINGS are directly comparable, and that is all
RRF uses. It also gives this module the property the whole build order
depends on: a leg that is not registered contributes nothing, so with one
leg the fused ranking IS that leg's ranking, unchanged. Adding the second
leg is additive, and removing it again is a revert rather than a migration.

Two legs today: agent/history_index.py's full text and
agent/episode_vectors.py's embeddings.
