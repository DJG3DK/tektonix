"""The review dashboard, proxied: /_review/{path}.

A seam out of agent/server.py (agent/routers/), cut on 2026-09-27 -- the
last route seam, and the one docs/todo.md said must never share a change
with provisioning.py or history_index.py. The route is unchanged;
tests/test_route_inventory.py pins its path, methods and guard, and
tests/test_review_proxy.py drives the handler directly for the two things a
proxy must not get wrong: who gets through, and what happens to a header
the caller supplied.

The handler reads nothing off app state: its authority is the session
(admin, via require_full_auth then auth.require_admin) and the control
secret comes from the environment at call time. httpx is used as a module
attribute so a test's stand-in AsyncClient is seen.

# live repo, so they bind loopback and publish nothing. On a host install nginx
# bridges the console to them at /_review/, injecting the shared secret the

# is the same bridge in the one process that is already the authenticated
# front door: admin, over the console's session, with the ports still
# unpublished (until 2026-09-20 Check now, the diff view and the manual merge
# worked only on a host install).
