"""The .env editor: what the dashboard may change without a shell.

A seam out of agent/server.py (agent/routers/). The routes are unchanged --
tests/test_route_inventory.py pins every path, method and guard, so a move
that altered any of them fails the snapshot rather than landing quietly.

Reads its state off `request.app.state` rather than importing `app` back from
server.py, which includes this router and would make that import a cycle.
