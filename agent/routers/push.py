"""Web push: the four routes the Settings toggle needs.

The first seam extracted from agent/server.py, and chosen for being the
smallest true one rather than the largest saving -- its job is to prove the
router pattern against tests/test_route_inventory.py, which pins every
route's path, method and auth dependency and therefore fails loudly if a move
changes any of them.

It reaches the auth pool through `request.app.state`, not by importing `app`
from server.py, because that import is a cycle: server.py includes this
router, so this module cannot import server.py at module scope. Every later
seam has the same constraint, which is the other thing this extraction is
here to establish.

The docstrings below are the ones these handlers already carried. They record
decisions -- why unsubscribe is deliberately not scoped to the caller, why
the key route also returns a count -- and moving code is not a reason to
lose them.
