"""Projects: onboarding, creation, removal, archives and deploy keys.

A seam out of agent/server.py (agent/routers/), cut on 2026-09-27. The
routes are unchanged -- tests/test_route_inventory.py and
tests/test_repo_scope.py pin every path, method, guard and repo check. All
of them are admin-only (`auth.require_admin` inside the handler, after
`require_full_auth`): a project entry names host paths and credential files.

agent/provisioning.py, agent/project_removal.py and agent/deploy_keys.py are
imported, not moved: docs/todo.md says provisioning.py and history_index.py
never travel with a seam, and the reason is in provisioning.py's docstring.

The three helpers the routes share take the app explicitly --
`_running_repos(app)`, `_provision_from_report(app, ...)`,
`_create_project(app, ...)` -- because importing `app` back from server.py,
which includes this router, would be a cycle. Through it they reach the
store, the auth pool, the config and `app.state.find_planning_meta`, the
planning lookup that stays in server.py with the turn machinery. server.py's
`_create_project_from_fields` binds `_create_project` to the app for the
planning router's new-project decision. The one route left in server.py that
reads a checkout's remote, POST /api/github/repos, reaches
`_project_remote_slugs` here for the same reason. PROJECTS is read off
`agent.config` at call time, so a test that swaps it is seen.
