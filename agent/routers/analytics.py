"""Analytics: the aggregates the dashboard's charts are drawn from.

The second seam out of agent/server.py (agent/routers/), and a deliberately
boring one: four read-only routes whose only reach outside themselves is the
store, the project list and agent/metrics.py. What it is really here to prove
is that a seam can carry its own module-level constants and its own long
comments across intact -- those comments are the record of what each number
means and why it is computed fresh rather than cached, and a split that drops
them costs more than the split saves.

`request.app.state.store` rather than an import of `app`: server.py includes
this router, so importing back from it is a cycle.
