"""Planning sessions: create, list, read, archive, delete, stop, message,
the new-project decision, and the session stream.

A seam out of agent/server.py (agent/routers/), cut on 2026-09-23 (follow-up
review, F8) after the tasks seam. The routes are unchanged --
tests/test_route_inventory.py and tests/test_repo_scope.py pin every path,
method, guard and repo check.

The planning TURN machinery stays in server.py: the background turn runner,
project creation, moving a session to a new project, the session lookup and
the agent builder. Routes reach them on `app.state` -- through wrappers the
server registers that look the name up in server.py at CALL time, so a test
that patches `server.build_planning_agent` or `server._find_planning_meta` is
still seen by a route here. `config` comes off app.state and PROJECTS off
agent.config, both at call time. Nothing here imports agent.server.
