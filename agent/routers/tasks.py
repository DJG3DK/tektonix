"""Build tasks: create, list, read, steer, approve, merge, delete, stream.

A seam out of agent/server.py (agent/routers/), cut on 2026-09-23 (follow-up
review, F8) once what these routes share had homes that do not import the
server: task creation in agent/tasks.py, the live run state (event fan-out,
live-log buffers, run slot, snapshots) in agent/task_runtime.py, the task
lifecycle in agent/lifecycle.py. The routes are unchanged --
tests/test_route_inventory.py and tests/test_repo_scope.py pin every path,
method, guard and repo check.

What stays in server.py is the graph stream that drives a run,
`_stream_graph`; routes reach it on `request.app.state.stream_graph`, and the
config on `request.app.state.config`, looked up at call time. PROJECTS is read
off `agent.config` the same way, so a test that swaps it is seen.

The old names stay importable from server.py (the endpoint functions, the
request models, `_readable_repos`), so callers and tests that reach for them
there are unchanged.

    in: add budget and continue rather than being stuck looking abandoned.

    Also covers a task orphaned by a backend restart mid-run -- Store still
    says "running" but nothing is actually driving it (this pm2 process gets
    restarted routinely to deploy fixes; a task that happened to be running
    at that moment would otherwise look "running" forever with no way back
    in either).

    These two cases need different handling:

    - Orphaned/stopped: patch `budget_usd`/`max_iterations`/`task_id`
      without `as_node` -- LangGraph resumes at whatever node the checkpoint
      already has as `next` (either "work", if the process died mid-work-pass
      or before one ever started, or "verify_and_ship", if it died between a
      completed work pass and the gate re-running). Nothing about escalated/
      pending_feedback is touched, so routing is exactly whatever it already
      was -- no replanning, no lost progress.
    - Genuine escalation: `_route_after_verify` (outer_graph.py) checks
      `state["escalated"]` first, before pending_feedback, so simply
      patching `escalated=False` is not enough on its own -- it also needs a
      truthy `pending_feedback` to route to "work" rather than falling
      through to END. Patched `as_node="verify_and_ship"` so the conditional
      edge re-evaluates against the new state and correctly resolves to
      "work". `pending_feedback` here doubles as the actual instruction the
      deep agent sees as a new HumanMessage on its next work.py pass (case 2
      in work.py's own docstring) -- not just a routing signal, real
      content: what the escalation was and that budget was added, plus the

    coordinator or a subagent proposed that matched a sensitive-path/
    dangerous-command pattern). Structurally the same resume mechanism
    resume_task's escalated branch uses -- patch state `as_node=
    "verify_and_ship"` with a truthy `pending_feedback` so
    `_route_after_verify` routes to "work", and let work_node's own
    graph_input priority logic (approval_decision checked before
    pending_feedback -- see work.py's own docstring case 0) do the real
    work of constructing `Command(resume={"decisions": [...]})` against the
    same inner thread, resuming it exactly where interrupt() paused it.

    One decision applies uniformly to every action_request in this batch
    (approve-all or reject-all) -- deepagents' own protocol technically
    supports a distinct decision per action_request, but the model
    virtually always proposes one risky call at a time in practice, and a
    per-action-request UI is real added complexity for a case that's
    rare enough not to justify it in this first pass.
