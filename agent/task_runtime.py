Out of agent/server.py on 2026-09-23 (follow-up review, F8), so the task and
planning routes can move to agent/routers/ without importing the server --
which includes those routers, so importing it back would be a cycle. Nothing
here imports agent.server.

server.py keeps its old names (`_publish`, `_live_task_log`, ...) as aliases
