"""Starting a build task: the one path every task comes through.

The New Task form, Build Now from a planning session and the GitHub inbox all
start tasks here, so a task is the same thing whoever started it -- same
classifier, same coder-seat decision, same budget default, same record.

Extracted from agent/server.py on 2026-09-23. It was the piece every remaining
router seam was waiting on: approving an inbox item starts a task, and so did
the task and planning routes, so none of them could leave server.py while
task creation lived there (docs/todo.md, "Split agent/server.py"). What stays
behind is the graph stream itself, `_stream_graph`, which drives the run and
publishes to the dashboard; it reaches this module's callers through
`app.state.stream_graph`, set when the app is created, rather than by import
-- the same way the routers reach server state without an import cycle.

server.py re-exports `write_task_meta` and `_attachments_note` as the SAME
objects and keeps `_start_task` as a one-line binding of `start_task` to its
app, so every existing call site and test override still lands.
