"""Username/password + TOTP 2FA login: argon2id hashing, RFC 6238 TOTP via
an encrypted-at-rest secret, one-time recovery codes -- deliberately
simplified on the session side to a single opaque, httpOnly session cookie
(hashed, stored server-side, revocable by deleting its row) rather than a
JWT access/refresh pair. An access/refresh split earns its keep at
customer-facing scale, where bounding the blast radius of a leaked token
matters more than the extra moving state; this is a 2-3-user internal tool,
and one server-side-revocable session covers the same practical need (a
cookie's contents are useless without a live database row, and logout or an
admin action can kill it immediately) with far less state to keep
consistent -- and it covers WebSocket auth for free, since a browser
attaches cookies to a WS handshake the same as any other request, where a
Bearer-header JWT would need a separate mechanism.

Schema lives in the SAME Postgres database this agent already uses for its
LangGraph checkpointer/store (config.pg_dsn) -- a real relational schema
(unique email, FK-cascaded sessions/recovery codes) rather than the
key-value Store, since uniqueness/cascade-delete are exactly the kind of
integrity a KV store can't give you for free.

Per-user project access: `allowed_repos` is NULL for a role="admin" account
(every configured repo, including ones added later, with no ACL table to
keep in sync) and an explicit list for role="user" (e.g. a restricted
account scoped to exactly one project). Checked via `check_repo_access`,
called explicitly by every repo-scoped endpoint in server.py -- not wired
through FastAPI's dependency-injection, since the existing endpoints take
`repo` in enough different shapes (query param, request body field, or
implied by an existing task/session's own stored repo) that one uniform DI
signature can't cover all of them without real risk of silently missing one.
