"""BudgetGuardMiddleware — the primary, code-enforced hard $ ceiling.

Enforces the budget with a check after every individual model call, inside
the model-call itself — the tightest enforcement point deepagents exposes
(`awrap_model_call`), a Python exception propagating out of the call rather
than a text instruction the model can ignore. This is the primary defense;
the outer `work` node's own watchdog over the whole astream() is a secondary
backstop, not a substitute.

Must be attached to the coordinator's own `middleware=[...]` and to every
subagent's own `middleware=[...]` list individually -- a SubAgent spec's
`middleware` list is merged in by name (replace-if-name-matches, else
append), never inherited by default. This does not mean subagents otherwise
run with an empty middleware stack -- deepagents auto-prepends its own fresh
FilesystemMiddleware/SubAgentMiddleware/summarization/PatchToolCallsMiddleware/
prompt-caching to every subagent independently of anything in `spec[
"middleware"]`. What's true, and the actual reason this class exists, is
narrower: our custom middleware specifically (this one) is never
auto-attached to a subagent just because it's on the coordinator -- that one
has to be listed explicitly per subagent, or that subagent spends
completely unmetered against the shared budget.

Cost is the router's own billed figure wherever it can be had, and an
estimate only until then. The router's exact `response_metadata["token_usage"]
["cost"]` is used when present, but it never is once a model call goes
through `agent.astream_events(..., version="v3")`: that API always registers
a `.messages` native projection, which forces every model call into a real
token stream, and the router's extra cost annotation does not survive
OpenAI-compatible SSE streaming no matter what `stream_usage`/`stream_options`
are set (the standard `usage_metadata` token counts come through fine with
`stream_usage=True` on `llm_for_role()`). So each call is first charged at
`agent/tools/model_rates.estimate_cost()` -- real token counts against live
OpenRouter rates, cache-aware -- and tagged with the `x-router-call-id` the
proxy returned in the response headers (`include_response_headers=True` on
`llm_for_role()`). The router logs that same id with OpenRouter's actual
`usage.cost` in logs/routing.jsonl as soon as the call completes, and
`BudgetTracker` swaps the estimate for the billed cost on its next read
(`agent/tools/router_ledger.py`). The ceiling is therefore enforced against
the router's own number for every call except the one that just finished --
and when THAT one's estimate would trip the ceiling, the guard waits up to
two seconds for its billed figure before ending a turn on an estimate. An
estimate 4.7x too high did exactly that on 2026-09-08 ($8.09 "spent" against
$1.72 billed), which is why the estimate is no longer the last word.

Shared tracker, not per-instance state: a BudgetGuardMiddleware that held
its own running total would let the ceiling be blown well past its intended
value, since coordinator and every subagent each get their own middleware
instance (see above) -- if each tracked independently, the coordinator could
spend up to budget_usd and each subagent could also independently spend up
to budget_usd, for a true aggregate of budget_usd * (1 + subagent_count),
not budget_usd. `BudgetTracker` is the one shared mutable object every
middleware instance for a given task invocation must wrap, so the ceiling is
enforced against the real aggregate spend across the coordinator and every
subagent call combined. Safe without locking because subagents in this
system run synchronously (the coordinator blocks on each `task()`
delegation) -- only one model call for the whole task is ever in flight at
a time.

    was invisible to the tracker: measured 2026-08-27 at $0.48 of $16.43 over
    48h (2.9% of all router spend) never counted against any ceiling.

    A LangChain callback fires on every call made BY the model object it is
    attached to, regardless of who invokes it or how -- which makes attaching
    this to the summarizer model itself (see `llm_for_role(callbacks=...)`)
