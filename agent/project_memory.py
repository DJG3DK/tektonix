    prompt would carry a confident list of sections and nothing behind it --
    so it degrades to the whole-file read instead, which is the behaviour of

    Which is why "all or nothing" is the rule here rather than "as much as we

    worst case of all is the one that reads as healthy: a pinned section whose
