"""The one place an episode is written.

An episode is the structured record of how a task ended: the goal, the
outcome, what it cost, and -- when it went wrong -- why. It is not loaded
into any task's context. It is read by the consolidation agent, which
distills patterns across episodes into the semantic memory that IS loaded.

This module exists because that 25-line writer was about to be edited by
three separate pieces of work at once: one wanting an embedding digest on
the record, one wanting the record handed to a search index as it is
written, one wanting extra telemetry fields on it. Three edits to one small
function in three commits is three chances to lose one of them in a merge,
and the thing being merged is the only durable record of what this system
has done.

The warning that made this module necessary, now acted on. The write used
to go through deepagents' StoreBackend.awrite, which stores a FileData
document -- content, encoding, and two timestamps -- and REBUILDS that
document from scratch on the way in, dropping every key it does not know.
The embed_text key the vector leg needs is exactly such a key, so it would
have been written and silently discarded. Worse than discarded: langgraph
emits no delete against store_vectors on an update, so an episode stripped
of its embed_text keeps the vector it had and goes on matching text it no
longer contains. So the value dict is composed here, in full, and written
with one store.aput. The FileData shape is reproduced exactly, because
consolidation.py's _read_episode and every other reader go back through
StoreBackend to read it.
