"""SWE-bench Verified, run through the real Tektonix pipeline and graded by the
official harness.

What makes the number a SWE-bench number, and so what this must not change:

* The tasks are the published dataset, SWE-bench/SWE-bench_Verified, as
  published: the agent gets the issue text (`problem_statement`) and the
  repository at the task's commit. Not the hints, not the tests that grade it.
* The environment is the task's own official image
  (`swebench/sweb.eval.x86_64.<id>`), with the code where the harness has it,
  /testbed, and its conda env active. The repository is copied OUT of that
  image rather than cloned, because several (astropy, scikit-learn) are built
  in place there, and because the image's history already ends at the task:
  the published fix is not in it.
* One attempt per task (pass@1). Each task is its own project, so nothing the
  agent learns or remembers on one reaches another.
* No internet: the published fix is on GitHub. A benchmark project has no
  GitHub, web or cross-project tools, and its sandbox has no network.
* Graded by `swebench.harness.run_evaluation`, never by us.

What is Tektonix's own and is part of the system being measured: the agent,
its gate (`checks` below: the changed files compile, the package imports), the
independent reviewer, and how the final diff becomes a prediction
(`prediction_patch`).
