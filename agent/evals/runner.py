"""Run the golden tasks, for real, and write down what happened.

This drives the SAME compiled graph a production task runs -- work node,
check suite, commit, the real reviewer. Not `_stream_graph`: that is server
plumbing (websocket fan-out, task meta, transcript recorders) and none of it
changes what the agent does. What is under test is the graph.

THE ONE THING IT DOES DIFFERENTLY IS NOT MERGING, AND IT DOES NOT NEED A
SPECIAL MODE TO DO IT. `require_merge_review=True` already parks a task after
a READY verdict, waiting for the operator's final look; the harness is simply
an operator who never clicks approve. The verdict is recorded, the episode is
written, `_route_after_verify` returns END, and no branch is merged anywhere.
A second code path for "run but do not ship" would be a path production never
takes, and it would drift.

WHAT MAKES A RUN COMPARABLE TO THE NEXT ONE.

Every task starts from a rebuilt fixture, so the repository state is identical
each time. The classifier is skipped -- the spec declares the category -- so a
one-shot model call cannot reroute a task between runs and change what is
being compared. Everything else, including which coder seat the task lands on,
is decided exactly as production decides it.

AND IT STOPS ON MONEY. Each task is a real agent run, so the suite tracks
cumulative spend and halts the moment the ceiling is crossed, reporting what
it has rather than continuing quietly.
