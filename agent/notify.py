"""Telegram alerts for the events an operator would act on.

Telegram, specifically, because the operator already lives there -- the
Another application on the box already alerts over Telegram, so this reuses a
channel that is already open on their phone rather than introducing a second
messaging system to configure and monitor.

Design constraints, in order:
  1. BEST-EFFORT, ALWAYS. An alert failing must never break, slow, or fail
     the thing it is alerting about. Every public function here swallows its
     own errors after logging them.
  2. One choke point per event class. Task alerts hook _stream_graph's
     terminal-status write (every rest state funnels through it), not a
     scatter of call sites.
  3. Details AND costs in every message (operator requirement, 2026-08-27):
     an alert should carry enough to decide "phone or laptop?" without
     opening the dashboard.

Recipients are every user with Telegram configured in Settings (bot token +
chat id, stored per-user in agent_users). This is a small-team deployment;
per-user routing rules can come later if it ever matters.
