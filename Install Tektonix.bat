REM It exists because a .ps1 cannot be double-clicked into running: Windows
REM opens it in Notepad, and even from a terminal the default execution policy
REM on client editions refuses it outright ("running scripts is disabled on
REM this system"). A .bat has neither problem, and -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
REM here applies to this one process only -- your machine's setting is not
REM touched.
REM
REM The pause at the end matters just as much: a window launched from Explorer
REM closes the instant the script ends, taking the result with it.
