"""The deployment table, read from the operator's own config.yaml.

The same file the dashboard's Models page writes to. That
is the whole migration story: none. Point MODEL_ROUTER_URL at this service and
every pin, cost figure and fallback rule carries over untouched.

Reloaded on change rather than at startup. The old proxy read the file once, so
repinning a model needed a router restart, and a restart kills every model call
in flight across every service sharing the router -- the one operation
docs/architecture.md tells you never to do while a task is running. Here the
file's mtime is checked per request (a stat, ~microseconds) and a changed file
is swapped in atomically between requests. In-flight calls keep the table they
started with.
