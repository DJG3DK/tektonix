"""The fastest providers of each pinned model, kept current.

93-99% of an agent task is spent waiting on the model (measured on SWE-bench
tasks, 2026-09-24), and one model runs at very different speeds on different
hosts: 9 tok/s on one provider, 104 on another, for the same weights. Unasked,
OpenRouter balances by price. The operator controls cost by the MODEL they
pin; which host serves it is ours to choose, and we choose speed.

OpenRouter's own `sort: "throughput"` is not used for this: on 2026-09-24 it
sent a model to a provider its own endpoint stats listed at a quarter of the
speed of the top three. So the router ranks the endpoints itself, from those
stats (`/models/<model>/endpoints`, last 30 minutes), and names them in order
with fallbacks allowed -- the fast hosts' shared pools do throw 429s, and the
next one on the list is the answer to that, not the slowest.

Speed is not only tokens per second. On 2026-09-24 the three fastest DeepSeek
hosts ran to the output ceiling on 2-3% of calls -- seven-plus minutes of
nothing, each -- while the slower ones never did, and a 50-task benchmark sat
on two tasks for forty minutes. So each host is also charged its measured
runaway rate, from this router's own ledger, times what a runaway costs at the
output cap: the expected time of a call, not the typical one.

Never on the request path: a call uses whatever ranking is cached, and a stale
or missing one is refreshed in the background. Until the first ranking lands,
build_body's `sort: "throughput"` default stands in.
