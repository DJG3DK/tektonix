"""Talking to OpenRouter.

Two paths, because the agent uses both: a buffered call for anything carrying
tools (deep_agent sets disable_streaming="tool_calling", after measuring that
re-merging tool-call chunks cost ~25 CPU-seconds per call), and a streamed one
for plain text. Embeddings take the buffered path against a second URL and
differ in nothing else.

Both must end up with the same ledger line, which is the whole difficulty of
the streaming path: the usage block arrives in the LAST chunk, after the body
has already been handed to the client. So the stream is passed through
untouched and the usage is scraped from the chunks on the way past.

`usage: {"include": true}` is added to every request. That is what makes
OpenRouter report `usage.cost` -- the real billed figure -- rather than us
multiplying tokens by a rate table that disagrees with the invoice.
