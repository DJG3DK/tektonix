// commit-reviewer.js — the independent post-commit review gate.
//
// Polls each project's live repository for an `agent/<task-id>` branch whose
// tip has not been reviewed. The review unit is that branch plus its
// merge-base with live. The branch is checked out into a detached worktree
// off the live repo, provisioned with live's node_modules (or a fresh
// --ignore-scripts install when a manifest changed or live's install is
// stale), read-only binds of the data the tests need, and review-only
// credentials -- never the live ones. The project's real checks, build,
// database and secret scans run there, contained (see runAgentCode).
//
// The model (the router's `agent-reviewer` alias) then gets one call: the
// diff, the commit messages, the agent's "Response to review round N"
// answers from the branch's commit log, the prior round's findings, the
// current test and referenced files, and the mechanical results. It answers
// with one submit_review tool call. The verdict is derived in Node from
// failed checks and blocking findings, never trusted from the model's field.
//
// Findings go to state.json (per project and per branch) and history.jsonl
// (append-only). The agent reads the verdict through its own verify_and_ship
// gate; nothing is pushed at it here, and nothing merges from here.
//
// This file is the entry point pm2 runs and keeps what ties a review
// together: the project map, the state and history files, which branch is
// the review unit, the queue, reviewProject's orchestration and the verdict,
// and the control server. The rest is in four modules -- exec.js (how
// anything is run), worktree.js (the review checkout), checks.js (the
// mechanical checks and whose failures they are) and prompt.js (what the
// model is shown and how its answer is read) -- and every name the tests
// import is still exported from here.
