# The bundle's generated secrets, written before Postgres starts.
#
# The database password and the model router's key used to be compose
# defaults -- `agent` and `sk-local-dev` -- identical in every installation
# and printed in the example .env. This writes a random one of each on first
# boot, and every service that needs one reads it from a file
# (POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE, MODEL_ROUTER_KEY_FILE).
#
# One volume per secret, mounted only where that secret is read: the
# password in `pgsecret` (the agent), the key in `routerkey` (the router,
# the agent, the commit reviewer). Both used to sit in one `bundlesecrets`
# volume that every consumer mounted whole, so the router and the reviewer
# could read the database password. That volume is still mounted here, and
# an upgrade's values are carried over from it on the first start.
#
# It runs here because postgres is the first service to start: everything
# else waits for it to be healthy, so the files exist before anyone reads
# them.
#
# An operator's own value in .env still wins on a fresh database -- except
# `sk-local-dev`, the old published default, which is treated as unset.
# On an initialised database a changed POSTGRES_PASSWORD is NOT applied:
# the image reads it on first init only, so writing it to the file the
# agent reads would give the agent a password the database does not have.
# Rotate with `--rotate` (below) instead.
#
#   docker compose exec postgres sh /tektonix/init-secrets.sh --rotate
#
# changes the role's password to the POSTGRES_PASSWORD the container was
# started with and rewrites the file; then `docker compose restart agent`.
